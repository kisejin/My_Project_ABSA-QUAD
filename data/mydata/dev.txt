It was a “mini vacation” within my tiring vacation. The villa had a private pool right on the beachfront. The beach was beautiful but the waves were too strong - so it was dangerous to swim. Good thing we had the private pool all to ourselves. My family really enjoyed the much needed relaxation. The bedrooms and bathrooms were very very clean. The beds were very comfortable.

1029,Our stay at Azerai was great. The staff were friendly and super attentive, and the facilities were nice and new. From the moment we were picked up, we were very well taken care of. One minor issue of an old razor being found in our room was made up for with a room upgrade. Food in the restaurant was good, albeit a little pricey but options in Can Tho were easy to access. The staff were great in recommending various places to visit. The highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local’s house while we waited for the rain to pass. Everything was super genuine and authentic - The guide, also a resort employee, grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing! Lastly the hotel transfer from Ho Chi Minh City was excellent - a comfortable limousine van which made the two hour trip each way enjoyable. Would recommend to visit, and stay in the Lake rooms. We started in the Garden Room, but the view from the Lake Room is better. If possible try avoid the weekends and local school holidays as the resort is much quieter.

Every evening, you can request a free foot bath which is delivered to your room. Additionally, Tuan and his team are available every minute of the day to help you out with questions, advice, little problems... Next to that, the rooms were very clean and the bed and shower were comfy. The hotel is a 5min walk from the city center, allowing for a relaxed atmosfere with beautiful scenery and nature sounds, though with easy access to the more busy city center. Free bicycles are available, as well as motorbikes for 100k/day + gas price. Transport service to the train station was easily arranged by Tuan. The mini-fridge was smelly and gave our water bottles a bad taste. Additionally, during hot days (37°C) the airconditioning was not strong enough to cool our bungalow room properly. However, by the evening when temperatures dropped, the room was cool enough to sleep in. ####[['The service was exceptional', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['You receive a welcome drink and snack when you arrive , and you receive a refreshing drink every time you get back to the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Every evening , you can request a free foot bath which is delivered to your room', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Tuan and his team are available every minute of the day to help you out with questions , advice , little problems', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Next to that , the rooms were very clean and the bed and shower were comfy', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hotel is a 5min walk from the city center', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['allowing for a relaxed atmosfere with beautiful scenery and nature sounds , though with easy access to the more busy city center', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Free bicycles are available , as well as motorbikes for 100k / day + gas price', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Transport service to the train station was easily arranged by Tuan', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The mini - fridge was smelly and gave our water bottles a bad taste', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Additionally , during hot days ( 37 ° C ) the airconditioning was not strong enough to cool our bungalow room properly', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

Sometimes, after silently chasing a gibbon family by following their sound, we stayed at the same spot for 15 minutes just to watch their activity. That time we feel like we are a part of the jungle. Homestay's facilities are good. You are also served by two other receptionists (a dog and her child). They will welcome you in the morning when you open your room and notify you when the food is ready.

138719,No breakfast, room had not been cleaned for three days. Awful smell in bathroom. We had to go and ask for clean towels . No fan or air conditioner in room. Shower, water did not run properly. Third morning, shower water was cold. Everything could be better. The name of this hotel is not the White House delux but the White House. Driver spent over half an hour trying to find this hotel because incorrect name. When we finally ascertained that the White House was the hotel that we booked, driver paid the staff out asking why was it called the White House delux, staff just laughed. Staff could not speak any english. Communication was poor. Often there was no one at reception. We booked a bus through reception for nha trang and were told it was going to leave at 8. 30am. We were told we could pay with credit card on leaving. We were told in four different times that the bus would leave at 8. 30am. In the morning when we were leaving we could not have a shower because the water was cold. When we got to reception at 7. 15am we were told that the bus was leaving at 7. 40 am. Then we were told that we had to pay the hotel and bus fare in cash. After finalising the bill the staff grabbed our bags and took off from the hotel and said we had to hurry for the bus. He then disappeared into the street somewhere with our bags. We could not see him anywhere. Finally we saw him up the road dragging our bags. Eventually we got to the bus and an argument between the driver and staff because we were late. When we arrived in nha trang we had notification from booking. com that we had stayed for two days instead of the three days that we had booked. We contacted booking. com who sorted this issue quickly. This hotel and staff appears to be dishonest. Would not stay here again. ####[['No breakfast', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['room had not been cleaned for three days . Awful smell in bathroom . We had to go and ask for clean towels .

1516,This is a cozy family home that has everything you need. Don't expect anything too fancy though. As a solo travel who usually stays at hostels, it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel. The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening. The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I've stayed at. Bathroom was shared but was always empty. The private room also locks. Everything I could ask for! Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market. The stairs inside the home are a little challenging. The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small (I had to navigate them going down with my feet sideways). Fortunately, my room was on the first level above ground, but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you. Also, finding the apartment was a little tricky. Finding the address of the building was fine. Take the concrete stairs up a flight and go down the first hall to your right. There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it's easy to miss. I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end, but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn't confirm if I was at the right place. I left but ended up being redirected back to the apartment. The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English. The whole family is lovely, but it can be hard to find the apartment. ####[['This is a cozy family home that has everything you need', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I ' ve stayed at", 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Bathroom was shared but was always empty', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The private room also locks', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Everything I could ask for', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The stairs inside the home are a little challenging', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['finding the apartment was a little tricky', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['my room was on the first level above ground , but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The whole family is lovely', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it can be hard to find the apartment', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end , but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn ' t confirm if I was at the right place", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it ' s easy to miss", 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

441,Well worth the price! Convenient location right by the airport. Premium looking finishes in the interior of the room and the hotel in general. Clean and fresh sheets everyday care of the excellent housekeeping. Great pool area and good view of the sunset from higher levels. Service and care from the front desk staff is EXCEPTIONAL, in addition to the good level of english they have. They are quick to respond to any concerns and queries guests have. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel as one of the budget-friendly options in the island. They lock the front doors at night but the staff are easily contactable to open the door even at early hours of the morning. Maybe the hotel could switch to a passcode/keycard system for this as not to disturb the staff too much?Food could also be a bit better but this is not too much of a drawback for the value you are getting from your stay. The location is also not the best as there is nothing too noteworthy in the immediate area, but Grab is easily accessible to downtown 10 minutes away.

139164,The room was fine. Nothing overwhelming. Small bathroom incl. a shower (not seperated) underneath the starecase. So definitely nothing for tall people. The homestay is very close to the beach and has a very nice design as advertised in the pictures although a little worn down in the room itself. In my case I didn't have a window - only one to the hall way. The owner is not living at the same place so I had to wait to get instructions about the key code etc. However, that also made it very easy to check-in and out. Overall, good value for your money and would stay another time, maybe in a bigger room (that was sold out at that time) There were quite a lot of (old) spider webs in my rooms.

140155,We stayed one night only as we missed our flight. We wished we stayed a longer period! We love the neighbourhood. As it was within a local district and not too near the busy Bui Vien Street.

138400,First impressions - amazing use of space and a great meet and greet. Breakfast - excellent, very fresh and different each day Laundry service - free and done for you, which is just great! Location - whilst not the most central location, the host got us taxi's as we couldn't use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim! We also used Google maps and the local bus, which is very cheap and reliable! So I didn't find location as issue at all. My husband loved the free gym! Whilst we did love our stay I feel it necessary to talk about what we didn't like. This place doesn't know what it wants yo be! It's guests are mainly young English teachers who actually live there medium to long term, so it's their home! We felt a bit like we were staying in their house. They are young, and with that came lots of night time noise, and socialising with friends not guests of the homestay right under our window until 2am on a couple of occasions. I expect young people to be noisy, it's normal, but I felt at the cost to other guests. This is because the place is mixed with different types of guests, and doesn't really have a true identity. This mixed with a very hard uncomfortable bed equaled a major lack of sleep for me! However, we did still enjoy our booking, but I feel this feedback is necessary for mid age guests, where noise might be an issue. ####[['amazing use of space and a great meet and greet', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast - excellent , very fresh and different each day', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Laundry service - free and done for you , which is just great', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Location - whilst not the most central location', 'Amenity', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ["the host got us taxi ' s as we couldn ' t use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['My husband loved the free gym', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we did love our stay', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we did still enjoy our booking', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

They only have four for I think 27 levels and one of them wasn’t working. Sometimes it took ten minutes until an elevator arrived. Breakfast is good but they only serve it from six to nine. And especially from eight to nine it is extremely crowded. The food in the in-room dining menu was only okay. From a five star hotel I expect much better food. What was also really annoying that you can’t charge anything to your room.

The organisation and communication was poor!! I requested a double bed but I had twin room. I’m the person who can’t sleep on a tiny bed. I realised that I made booking with an individual owner, not with the hotel which means any issue you have to deal directly with the owner, not the hotel staff. The staff from the owner came without notice, ring the bell and ask to pay the bill. She admitted her mistake of not providing a double bed and reduced the payment. regardless I couldn’t sleep. This room includes breakfast but be aware that it’s not hotel breakfast!!!! They take you to a local eatery for breakfast. The owner poorly communicates so the restaurant staff asked me to pay for the meal. After a looooooooooong and frustrating conversations between hotel management, owner and restaurant staff, you will be told by the owner “I will pay”. That’s it. He just hang off the phone!!!

138760,The pool was nice. The location (close to the night market) was also good. I would really not recommend this hotel. We are by no means picky people and have travelled extensively, but this is one of the worst hotels we have ever encountered in terms of price/quality. The room was not cleaned before our arrival (two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it, thus also no clean towels. The place did not only have cockroaches upon arrival, but we kept encountering them. Although we know this might just be the climate, we did not encounter them anywhere else during 3 weeks in Vietnam. The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up, which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm. The water pressure was almost non existent. The airconditioning did not work most of the time. Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible. The staff did not speak a word of English. We had to communicate via Google translate. Overall, this place calls itself a resort, but in comparison with some of the significantly lower priced homestays or other hotels we had throughout three weeks in Vietnam, we would barely call this place a hotel and definitely not a resort.

1852,Fantastic stay at this hotel...staff were truly amazing and nothing was too much trouble. ..the sunsets from the infinity pool were truly spectacular. ..rooms were well cared for and serviced every day...lots of little touches that made this hotel really stand out..the staff were amazing especially Jenny at breakfast time and Ha in the restaurant. Food quality both at breakfast time and in the restaurant was very good. Great choice for breakfast and a decent choice dining in the restaurant. The restaurant was as reasonable as dining out but the quality was probably better on the whole. Rooms very comfortable and in very good condition. There was nothing not to like at this hotel.

1042,We did an extensive review (in person as well) of all the hotels in the area and I would say this one is the best one. The design of the hotel is super nice, with a very warm and crafty feeling! The views are absolutely gorgeous. The rooms are big and comfortable. I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics. The room was clean, bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white. The maintenance of the hotel is not the best, which is a real pity, because it was designed so nicely. When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage. The hot water is very inconsistent when showering, sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself! Some staff is nice, others not so much. I think the language barrier is the biggest problem because almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude, which I don't think it's their intention. I would suggest the management trains the people a bit better. ####[['The design of the hotel is super nice , with a very warm and crafty feeling', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The views are absolutely gorgeous', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The rooms are big and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room was clean , bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The maintenance of the hotel is not the best , which is a real pity , because it was designed so nicely', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage .', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The hot water is very inconsistent when showering , sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Some staff is nice', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I think the language barrier is the biggest problem', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['I would suggest the management trains the people a bit better', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['all the hotels in the area and I would say this one is the best one', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

138745,Facilities are very good. The swimming pool is on the rooftop and an infinity pool and it’s stunning especially when the Sun is shining you can just spend the day there topping up your tan and drinking cocktails. In The evening they have a band playing in the sky bar which is nice and jolly. The food choice at the rooftop pool and bar area is very disappointing and it’s expensive. However I would recommend the steakhouse. The service is pretty slow at reception I waited seven hours for them to fix my phone in my room. Had to call off my mobile phone several times to remind them and the air con wasn’t working and as no one turned up I ended up having to go down stairs in my pjs to ask for someone to come up. I stayed there this time last year and the service was much better so it’s definitely gone downhill. I spoke to the manager about it and they did let me extend my checkout time for free as compensation.

1467,This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach. The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach, but since the beach wasn't very busy, you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across. The resort itself is extensive but it doesn't feel too large; it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends, so these times are busy. The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps. There are plenty of beds around that pool and you can have drinks there. The restaurant is good, so spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option. The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration. On the whole, the design of the place is amazing, with plenty of Koi carp ponds, wooden carving, well-maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms. The staffs were amazing and it's really nice to talk to them (thank you Ann!). What has been the best for us was the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil, a nice pool, the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well (Covid had closed that down). It's worth it staying there for a week or more if you're looking for a relaxing pool/beach holiday, but for food you have to either use their restaurant, or use a few local restaurants nearby - or go into town, of course (which you have to as Hoi An is an amazing, but touristy, town!) It's not so much what we didn't like, but maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well. Also, the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient, but the last one back from town is at 17. 30, so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back, which is a bit of a hassle when it gets busy. ####[['This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the design of the place is amazing , with plenty of Koi carp ponds , wooden carving , well - maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["The staffs were amazing and it ' s really nice to talk to them", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil , a nice pool , the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["It ' s worth it staying there for a week or more if you ' re looking for a relaxing pool / beach holiday", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient , but the last one back from town is at 17 . 30 , so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The resort itself is extensive', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There are plenty of beds around that pool', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The restaurant is good', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['you can have drinks there', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["the beach wasn ' t very busy , you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends , so these times are busy', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

194,Staff was nice REALLY DIRTY, with many traces from other customers. The room was very small (which is ok in another context) but it didnt even have a proper window. The only window was facing a wall, so it was claustrophobic. They seem to have 2 types of rooms, the ones from the outside bulding, which I guess are the ones showing in booking, and the ones from the back building. Our room had absolutely nothing to do with the pictures! Ask them to show you the room at least before paying. It was DISGUSTING staying at this place, such an overpiced hotel! Dont waste your money here!The good rating in Booking is probably due to the staff actively asking you to put them a review of 10 when you leave…The only positive thing is the staff is helpful, even though many of them dont speak english ####[['Staff was nice', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['REALLY DIRTY , with many traces from other customers', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The room was very small', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['it didnt even have a proper window', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The only window was facing a wall , so it was claustrophobic', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['It was DISGUSTING staying at this place , such an overpiced hotel', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Dont waste your money here', 'Loyalty', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The only positive thing is the staff is helpful , even though many of them dont speak english', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our room had absolutely nothing to do with the pictures', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Ask them to show you the room at least before paying', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

139603,Location: 300-800m near buses, Co-Op mart, and 10-15 min walk to the main beaches. Personnel: the owner/receptionist is particularly annoying. 1. there is no price list. So she could charge anything, disregarding the Booking's price. if you don't agree she would put you in a small stuffy smoking-smelling room, not as in the picture advertised. You are not allowed to remove the tray. 2. there is no cup/glass, or kettle available to discourage eating or drinking in the room. She had a set mind and tried to rule you as much as possible such as locking away all remote controls in the draw, and telling me that" no need to touch /change them". 3. When I complained about the TV not working and the water from the basin leaking on the bathroom floor, she was very argumentative, trying to put the blame on me. Instead of examining the problems or being willing to fix the issues. She was loud and aggressive and disregarded anything I said or requested persistently. She would never stop talking, once she was in my room. 4. The first day when I arrived I gave her my ID, she did not have any question. After she got to know me in he afternoon, she asked me if I have money to lend her, I laughed and left. When I got back that night I told her that I was very sick. She did not care but kept dragging on questioning my ID , trying to cause me trouble. I was very tired and sick and she would not leave me alone. When I told her that I was willing to pack my bag and leave immediately (eventhough it was almost midnight). She then shut up, and let me go to rest. The next day, the Bell boy asked me nicely if I would stay another day as booked, and tried fixing the leaking basin. So I stayed and She left me alone since. 5. Everyday, room was not cleaned nor rubbished being collected so brought them down to reception bin, she made me to throw them outside the building site. Lastly, I forgot to collect my ID after settling the account. upon realising, I called and asked her nicely to send it to my address in Saigon. ####[['300 - 800m near buses , Co - Op mart , and 10 - 15 min walk to the main beaches', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['he owner / receptionist is particularly annoying', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["there is no price list .

139427,Sapa garden is a little oasis of beauty about 2 kilometers outside of Sapa center. The rooms are comfortable and big, (we were in the Kings room with a balcony.) The property offers several breakfast options including eggs, pancakes or yogurt and fruit. They also do dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed a menu of chicken stir-fry, shrimp stir-fry and spring rolls at the property. Much better quality than the dinner we had in Sapa. But the gem is the gardens surrounding the property, they are absolutely stunning. There are several sitting areas to enjoy a glass of wine in the evening. In addition the staff is very helpful and accommodating. Mr. Nam Hong can arrange a guide for treks in the area and tickets for Fansipan mountain. Laundry service is also available.

We had an airport transfer arranged but we couldn't find the driver at the airport plus there wasnt a sim card for sale at the arrival area we went out from, so we took a cab, and he offered to pay for the extra amount. He was always speaking to us and making our stay as comfortable as he can. The place was clean and beds were huge and comfortable. My wife and I love the pho for breakfast! The room had a musty, wooden smell to it that sticks to your clothes. Other than that, I think it slightly exceeds what you pay for. ####[['The staff , especially the manager was very accommodating to us', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We had an airport transfer arranged', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["we couldn ' t find the driver at the airport plus there wasnt a sim card for sale at the arrival area we went out from , so we took a cab", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['he offered to pay for the extra amount', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['He was always speaking to us and making our stay as comfortable as he can', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The place was clean and beds were huge and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['My wife and I love the pho for breakfast', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room had a musty , wooden smell to it that sticks to your clothes', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I think it slightly exceeds what you pay for', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

140239,Pretty much the perfect stay. This resort is pretty amazing. It's right on the ocean and has got a gigantic swimming pool with a bar in it and tons of comfy mattresses and long chairs to chill, enjoy the sun and read a book. The three restaurants on site are pretty good and the breakfast definitely wins it all. That buffet is the best way to start the day. Room was very comfy, great bed, spacious, clean and with the private pool it was just the cherry on top. But what made our stay even better was the staff. The whole staff team was absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel. If we really want to find a couple of things to improve, then it would be: - a bit more maintainance of the pool mattresses and long chairs which are showing a bit of fatigue.- the price of the restaurants which is a bit high. ####[["It ' s right on the ocean", 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['got a gigantic swimming pool with a bar in it and tons of comfy mattresses and long chairs to chill', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The three restaurants on site are pretty good', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the breakfast definitely wins it all', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Room was very comfy , great bed , spacious , clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the private pool it was just the cherry on top', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['what made our stay even better was the staff', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The whole staff team was absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['a bit more maintainance of the pool mattresses and long chairs which are showing a bit of fatigue', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['the price of the restaurants which is a bit high', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['high', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

In a authentic Vietnamese alley and market street locale. Room was a good size. Air conditioning worked well and a nice bathroom. Good work space and table with chairs. View of the city. It's probably a 2 star equivalent in Europe with a 3 or 4 star shower. Would suit a long stay. Like a month to really emmerse in the city or if you had studies to do. Would recommend this hostel/hotel. They take visa and card payments which is great option. Like most things really at this price point. But only thing really was the door to my room number 5 on 4th floor, was a little battered and slight cracks and gaps could be seen. But it did lock! The other doors seemed in better shape.
