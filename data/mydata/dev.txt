1299,Staying at Hmong Sister House was a truly memorable experience. From the moment I arrived, I was struck by the warm and friendly atmosphere of the homestay. Lily, the hostess, was incredibly welcoming and made sure that I felt right at home. The homestay itself is a beautifully designed wooden house, filled with traditional Hmong crafts and artifacts. The surrounding natural landscape is breathtakingly beautiful, with rolling hills and lush forests stretching out in every direction. Even though the weather was a bit chilly during my stay, the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the house made me feel comfortable and relaxed. I loved the chance to learn more about Hmong culture and traditions during my stay, and appreciated Lily's insights and stories about her own experiences. Overall, I would highly recommend Hmong Sister House to anyone looking for a unique and authentic travel experience, and I can't wait to come back and visit again in the future. ####[['Staying at Hmong Sister House was a truly memorable experience', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['From the moment I arrived , I was struck by the warm and friendly atmosphere of the homestay', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Lily , the hostess , was incredibly welcoming and made sure that I felt right at home', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The homestay itself is a beautifully designed wooden house , filled with traditional Hmong crafts and artifacts', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The surrounding natural landscape is breathtakingly beautiful , with rolling hills and lush forests stretching out in every direction', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Even though the weather was a bit chilly during my stay , the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the house made me feel comfortable and relaxed', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["I loved the chance to learn more about Hmong culture and traditions during my stay , and appreciated Lily ' s insights and stories about her own experiences", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I would highly recommend Hmong Sister House to anyone looking for a unique and authentic travel experience', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["I can ' t wait to come back and visit again in the future", 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

I booked the first portion of our stay on booking. com at a discounted rate. The cost for 3 nights pre booked was the same cost as a 1 night extension that was booked at the hostel.

1042,We did an extensive review (in person as well) of all the hotels in the area and I would say this one is the best one. The design of the hotel is super nice, with a very warm and crafty feeling! The views are absolutely gorgeous. The rooms are big and comfortable. I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics. The room was clean, bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white. The maintenance of the hotel is not the best, which is a real pity, because it was designed so nicely. When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage. The hot water is very inconsistent when showering, sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself!

Additionally, Tuan and his team are available every minute of the day to help you out with questions, advice, little problems... Next to that, the rooms were very clean and the bed and shower were comfy. The hotel is a 5min walk from the city center, allowing for a relaxed atmosfere with beautiful scenery and nature sounds, though with easy access to the more busy city center. Free bicycles are available, as well as motorbikes for 100k/day + gas price. Transport service to the train station was easily arranged by Tuan. The mini-fridge was smelly and gave our water bottles a bad taste. Additionally, during hot days (37°C) the airconditioning was not strong enough to cool our bungalow room properly. However, by the evening when temperatures dropped, the room was cool enough to sleep in. ####[['The service was exceptional', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['You receive a welcome drink and snack when you arrive , and you receive a refreshing drink every time you get back to the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Every evening , you can request a free foot bath which is delivered to your room', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Tuan and his team are available every minute of the day to help you out with questions , advice , little problems', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Next to that , the rooms were very clean and the bed and shower were comfy', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hotel is a 5min walk from the city center', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['allowing for a relaxed atmosfere with beautiful scenery and nature sounds , though with easy access to the more busy city center', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Free bicycles are available , as well as motorbikes for 100k / day + gas price', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Transport service to the train station was easily arranged by Tuan', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The mini - fridge was smelly and gave our water bottles a bad taste', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Additionally , during hot days ( 37 ° C ) the airconditioning was not strong enough to cool our bungalow room properly', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

139234,The hotel is great and fully renewed a year ago. Spacious rooms, clean, close to the beach and lovely staff. Best price quality you can get by far in Vietnam! Nhung is adorable and made our stay perfect. She was always there to help with anything, be it renting a motorcycle, giving general tips, booking tickets for us or doing our laundry. The breakfast is great, you can chose one dish out of a list of ~30 dishes. We tried many of them and they were all tasty! It also includes fruits, coffee and a different juice everyday. The location is perfect if you want beach and not stay in the busy and very touristy old city town. The hotel has bikes available that you can use whenever you want to go into town (15-20 min ride ) or you can rent a motorcycle if you have the license. Driving in Hoi An is much easier than the busier Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh.

1467,This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach. The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach, but since the beach wasn't very busy, you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across. The resort itself is extensive but it doesn't feel too large; it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends, so these times are busy. The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps. There are plenty of beds around that pool and you can have drinks there. The restaurant is good, so spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option. The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration. On the whole, the design of the place is amazing, with plenty of Koi carp ponds, wooden carving, well-maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms. The staffs were amazing and it's really nice to talk to them (thank you Ann!). What has been the best for us was the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil, a nice pool, the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well (Covid had closed that down). It's worth it staying there for a week or more if you're looking for a relaxing pool/beach holiday, but for food you have to either use their restaurant, or use a few local restaurants nearby - or go into town, of course (which you have to as Hoi An is an amazing, but touristy, town!) It's not so much what we didn't like, but maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well. Also, the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient, but the last one back from town is at 17. 30, so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back, which is a bit of a hassle when it gets busy. ####[['This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the design of the place is amazing , with plenty of Koi carp ponds , wooden carving , well - maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["The staffs were amazing and it ' s really nice to talk to them", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil , a nice pool , the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["It ' s worth it staying there for a week or more if you ' re looking for a relaxing pool / beach holiday", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient , but the last one back from town is at 17 . 30 , so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The resort itself is extensive', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There are plenty of beds around that pool', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The restaurant is good', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['you can have drinks there', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["the beach wasn ' t very busy , you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends , so these times are busy', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

1954,Location was great. - We booked a double bed and when we arrived at the hotel we were told that is wasn’t available. No phone call prior to let us know before hand so we could cancel and find other arrangements. - I sent a message to the other hotel to ask if we could check in early. No reply. - No shower head holder in the shower. Shower gel and conditioner bottles were empty. - The “king bed” is actually just 2 single beds pushed together. Makes for a very uncomfortable sleep. - Staff don’t speak English. - We asked for an iron. 20min later it arrived. The next morning around 6am we were woken by reception calling us to ask for the iron back. - Staff called our room while we were sleeping to ask if we paid our bill with cash or credit card. ####[['Location was great', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We booked a double bed and when we arrived at the hotel we were told that is wasn ’ t available', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['No phone call prior to let us know before hand so we could cancel and find other arrangements', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['No shower head holder in the shower', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Shower gel and conditioner bottles were empty', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The “ king bed ” is actually just 2 single beds pushed together', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Makes for a very uncomfortable sleep', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Staff don ’ t speak English', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We asked for an iron . 20min later it arrived', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The next morning around 6am we were woken by reception calling us to ask for the iron back', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Staff called our room while we were sleeping to ask if we paid our bill with cash or credit card', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I sent a message to the other hotel to ask if we could check in early', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['No reply', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]
139759,Ideally located (10 minutes walk from Van Long nature reserve - however see negative comments below), exceptionally beautiful and well maintained grounds, excellent breakfast and the dining menu at the restaurant was very good. Rooms are more like private bungalows and were clean and comfortable. The resort, despite it's beautiful trimmings is not good value money - it's actually a greedy money grab. One particular incident left a very sour note for us. The Van Long nature reserve is literally 10 minutes walk away and the normal booking price at the ticketing office for a boatman is 70k per boat. The resort charged us over 200k per person for this "tour" for which all they did was save us the walk by dropping us with their golf cart. Their golf cart driver literally paid the ticketing office the basic fee and dropped us then came back it pick us up. So essentially we paid for the convenience of a 5 minute golf cart ride. I find this extremely greedy. A resort of this of this size should upfront be offering this information and/or even providing this drop off service for free to guests.

139250,The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture. There were ample electrical socketss. The bathroom and plumbing was quite good. The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy. There was plenty of parking near the gate. There was easy access to a lovely clean beach, direct from the resort. There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures. it was surrounded by trees giving ample shade to the loungers. The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view. There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure, Napoli being the best. We have used this one many times in the past. There are some small local shops ( kiosks) for basic needs. The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer. Not much! Like a lot of the resorts here, they suffer from a lack of customers during covid so have an air of being a bit run-down. However the faults were minor and did not detract from our stay. The restaurant only had a partial service due to lack of customers. There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning, when the resort filled up for the weekend. At other times there was a limited menu. There wasn't anywhere to hang wet clothes after, say, a swim and nothing to sit on outside. ####[['The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There were ample electrical socketss', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The bathroom and plumbing was quite good', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was plenty of parking near the gate', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was easy access to a lovely clean beach , direct from the resort', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure , Napoli being the best', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There are some small local shops ( kiosks ) for basic needs', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning , when the resort filled up for the weekend', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['At other times there was a limited menu', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["There wasn ' t anywhere to hang wet clothes after , say , a swim and nothing to sit on outside", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

139855,Good location around 5 minutes from the beach. The rooftop pool had a good view across the city. The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con, comfy bed, fridge, toiletries. The hotel was very noisy. We had a large family who used the hallway and lift as a playground, with the children screaming and crying while the parents shouted up and down the hallway from 5. 30am until midnight each day. We told reception who didn't care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy. There are alarms on the hotel bedroom doors as they are awkward to close, the alarms are good for safety however the other rooms would leave their doors open with the alarms beeping from early until late which again kept us awake. The hotel is not 4*, more 2 or 3*, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating. The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily. The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up. We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym, just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment, no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill. There are lots of hotels in the area - I wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price. ####[['Good location around 5 minutes from the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The rooftop pool had a good view across the city .', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con , comfy bed , fridge , toiletries', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hotel was very noisy', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["We told reception who didn ' t care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The hotel is not 4 *, more 2 or 3 *, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym , just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment , no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

It's really a good compromise if you want to stay few nights here but without passing a lot of time in your room. ####[["the room didn ' t have an open window", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["You ' re in the city ' s center , everyting is close by foot", 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["the room is clean , and you don ' t hear the others rooms or the noise from the outside", 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["It ' s really a good compromise if you want to stay few nights here but without passing a lot of time in your room", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

1455,The place is exactly as expected from the pictures and reviews. The owner helped us upgrade one twin room to a family room, and it was very spacious. She also helped arrange bikes and motorbikes for us to borrow to travel to the city center and helped troubleshoot problems when needed. Overall, we were very impressed with the hospitality. We arrived by car from Da Nang and had some trouble navigating since the alley to this place was very narrow, but there was some parking space in front of the villa itself so it wasn't a problem. You will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away (free bikes, motorbikes, car - bit difficult considering the alley, or taxis and other options).Some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim - to fit the vibe. I wouldn't recommend this place for those with small children because the pool facilities and general structure of the place are not very child-friendly. ####[['The place is exactly as expected from the pictures and reviews', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The owner helped us upgrade one twin room to a family room', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it was very spacious', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['She also helped arrange bikes and motorbikes for us to borrow to travel to the city center and helped troubleshoot problems when needed', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Overall , we were very impressed with the hospitality', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['there was some parking space in front of the villa itself', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['You will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away', 'Amenity', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["I wouldn ' t recommend this place for those with small children", 'Loyalty', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the pool facilities and general structure of the place are not very child - friendly', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

1300,The breakfast served at the pantry on the 5th floor every morning was good because I could have a light breakfast. In particular, the soup of rice noodles is very delicious, so I recommend you to try it. The location of the accommodation is near Miding, but it's a little far away. Please note that it's not a distance that you can't walk at all, but it'll be a burden to walk in the middle of the heat. Fortunately, you can visit various attractions in Hanoi using the grap service. The room condition is very very excellent. A comfortable bed and living room(has a comfortable sofa) are provided, and simple cooking is possible with a simple kitchen. I was able to travel comfortably because they cleaned and managed it every day. Also, there was a washing machine on the balcony, and it was so nice to be able to wash wet clothes with sweat. The product description says that there are four bathrooms in three rooms, but in reality, there are three bathrooms in three rooms. The toilet tissue location is so far away that you have to twist your body into an acrobatic way to touch the tissue. There is no space to put shampoo or soap in the shower booth. There's not enough space to put soap in the sink. In addition, it does not provide soap. Items provided include shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush, and toothpaste. ####[['The breakfast served at the pantry on the 5th floor every morning was good because I could have a light breakfast', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the soup of rice noodles is very delicious', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["The location of the accommodation is near Miding , but it ' s a little far away", 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["Please note that it ' s not a distance that you can ' t walk at all , but it ' ll be a burden to walk in the middle of the heat", 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['you can visit various attractions in Hanoi using the grap service', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room condition is very very excellent', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['A comfortable bed and living room', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['are provided , and simple cooking is possible with a simple kitchen', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['they cleaned and managed it every day', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['there was a washing machine on the balcony , and it was so nice to be able to wash wet clothes with sweat', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The product description says that there are four bathrooms in three rooms , but in reality , there are three bathrooms in three rooms', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The toilet tissue location is so far away that you have to twist your body into an acrobatic way to touch the tissue', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['There is no space to put shampoo or soap in the shower booth', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["There ' s not enough space to put soap in the sink", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['it does not provide soap', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Items provided include shampoo , conditioner , toothbrush , and toothpaste', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I was able to travel comfortably', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

138775,Lovely little hotel, friendly staff, spoke minimal English but they tried their best to be helpful and assist in anyway they could. My room was spacious, much bigger than I expected, loved the bathroom as well. It's about 10 min walk to the town centre, 15 min to the old town. Breakfast was great, a mixed of local dishes and some continental items. The coffee was so good!! If the designer had made the bathroom a foot bigger, then the shower cubicle door could open fully and not hitting on the bathtub.

When we reached there was nobody at the reception & just a phone no. Mentioned to call some one. Now imagine a person from outside country may not have calling accessibility then how will they call? Our taxi driver helped us for the same. The staff ( lady) was trying to be nice when we expressed our un likeness of the room & said we are giving you scooty rental in discount but later we came to know that she actually charged a higher amount from us then available outside. The breakfast was also very average, mostly bread was given & no butter. Only when asked it was provided... No eggs or anything.. we totally regret our decision to book this property.

1498,The hostel's staff is one of the nicest and kindest I've met during my travesl. They always take interest in you and are very patient and helpful, and give the hostel a homey feeling. The rooms are spacious, nice and cosy, good smell, and the beds are super comfortable. I really liked the storage arrangment. I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that! The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom. First, it was located on the bottom floor seperated from all the rooms in the hostel. The way there is exposed with no ceiling. On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom. I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way. The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well. As it is raining quite often in Sapa I think that's a problem... also there's only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel. Another thing to mind is the location - it's about 10-15 min. climb up the hill from town. It's not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather. ####[["The hostel ' s staff is one of the nicest and kindest I ' ve met during my travesl", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They always take interest in you and are very patient and helpful , and give the hostel a homey feeling', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The rooms are spacious , nice and cosy , good smell , and the beds are super comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I really liked the storage arrangment', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The way there is exposed with no ceiling', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["there ' s only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["Another thing to mind is the location - it ' s about 10 - 15 min", 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['climb up the hill from town', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["It ' s not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

139460,Our experience at Zizi homestay in Sapa was a spiritual journey that allowed us to witness the sacred rituals and beliefs of the Hmong community. The lodge, surrounded by towering peaks, provided a breathtaking setting for our trek. The guided trek led us through sacred sites, ancient temples, and shared moments of spiritual reflection. Each step felt like a step towards embracing the sacred wisdom of Hmong culture. The reverent hosts guided us through traditional ceremonies, offering us insight into their spiritual practices. Back at the lodge, we were treated to a sacred ritual, witnessing the deep reverence the Hmong have for their ancestors and nature. As the sun set, we gathered for a contemplative meditation session, enveloped in the profound tranquility of the mountains. While our overall experience was fantastic, some guests noticed occasional water supply disruptions, which added to the rustic charm but might cause minor inconveniences. However, it became an opportunity to appreciate the sacred connection the lodge has with nature and the mountains.

The gym is great with good facilities, we had a lovely massage at the spa, and the pool area is gorgeous it’s just such a shame we couldn’t enjoy it as the weather was sadly terrible for entire duration of our stay!

Tien is an amazing generous and selfless person. He arranged transport, offered to watch our luggages for a few days while we were out of town and most importantly, he was available and always here to help. I got sick with the flu during the trip and he was able to book me last minute another stay so I could rest.

139608,The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport. The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance. Owner stays just next door so it’s easy to reach out if you have any issues provided that she’s at home. Room is comfy and clean. Aircon is a little weak but it works. Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair. Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin. Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin. Owner gave the pin to the metal gate via message through Booking. com’s app but just note that the metal gate is right in front of the apartment on the 5th floor, not the big gate on ground floor facing the street. Since the apartment is located on the 2nd street away from the main road, it’s not too noisy at night. The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries. There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe. The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift. Luckily there is a cement strip laid over the staircase which probably is meant for bicycles but it works fine to roll my small suitcase up. You’re also supposed to pay your room fee upon arrival in cash - which the fault is mine since I didn’t read carefully before booking. So be prepared to bring extra cash, or exchange money in the many shops at the night market. ####[['The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance', 'Amenity', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Aircon is a little weak but it works', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Room is comfy and clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

It was nice to have breakfast in the room. You can choose to have brekkie by the pool, in the lobby area or in your room. They even made sure to offer us glutenfree breakfast. Pool is quite small but in a nice area with sauna and steamroom which you can turn on yourself. Shower / toilet have been built against a huge rock, which makes the area quite unique. The spa upstairs is great, the massage therapists are very good, and one spa treatment is included in the room price. With the free shuttle bus you can go anywhere in the town. Motorbike can be parked in the parking hall. Whoever built the Wind hotels concept knows a lot about excellent customer service and customer retention. We definitely want to go back and can highly recommend this hotel to everyone!

The breakfast was wonderful with so many choices in the lovely room overlooking the lake and old town Hanoi.

Anthony, Leo, and Simon were particularly helpful at the front desk with anything we needed. Staff goes above and beyond to care for you. This was the perfect place to start and end our month long journey in Vietnam. This was my second stay and I did not like the bathtub/shower combo unit in my room this time. It leaked all over the floor and was very annoying. In my first room, I had a walk-in shower that did not have this issue.

139849,Good amount of space to be had on offer....nice big shower/bathroom with a view over the fairly busy city street. Double glazed ( in a fashion ) so noise not an issue. Elevator up to room. Washing available, good wi-fi, full kitchen. Location is awesome in so many ways.... amazing street food right outside as well as restaurant food ( including a lot of good Japanese restaurants nearby ), easy & interesting walk to Ben Thanh markets.... Location also puts it near to quasi- sleazy venues as well if that offends you in any way.

19,The location was great, a big yet quiet street, close to the city centre and other good local restaurants. We stayed in an 8-bed dormitory room, yet there was still enough space left to place our luggages and sit around. The bunk bed was far large enough for 1 person to roll around, power outlet and curtain were equiped for each single bed, which was a big plus. The host was super hospitable and helpful. You can always ask her for the guidance to anywhere around Cao Bang. She even accepted our late check out request when our car only arrived at 2pm. If you need more slippers or change the towels, they could always support. It would be better if there is more dust bin inside the room. There was only 1 in the bathroom when we stayed. There were still some dust/ cloth dust on our beds/ bedsheets when we arrived. Apart from that, all were great. ####[['The location was great', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['close to the city centre and other good local restaurants', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The bunk bed was far large enough for 1 person to roll around', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['power outlet and curtain were equiped for each single bed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The host was super hospitable and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['You can always ask her for the guidance to anywhere around Cao Bang', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['She even accepted our late check out request when our car only arrived at 2pm', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['If you need more slippers or change the towels , they could always support', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['It would be better if there is more dust bin inside the room', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['some dust / cloth dust on our beds / bedsheets', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We stayed in an 8 - bed dormitory room , yet there was still enough space left to place our luggages and sit around', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['a big yet quiet street', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

I also got a late checking and a heater because it's really cold in Ha Noi these day. I felt warm and comfy. I am very happy I stayed there. I liked everything but I think it is also due to the Covid time and the fact that there was noone in the room next door.

52,The hotel itself is quite a nice looking building. It's in Da Nang, and the staff are pretty nice! The shower is big and the water pressure is good. Decent place to work as well, because of the good Wi Fi. The price was amazing. Really incredibly cheap for what you get. The bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet, there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed, the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area. I'm not sure if it was a residential building as well, but there was a family staying on our floor that had two rooms, and left the door open between them, yelling very loudly in the hallway at all hours. Overall it was just not relaxing or comfortable. I can't hold anything against the staff, but my experience here was dreadful. I'm sorry. But I do hope my feedback goes somewhere, since there are positive aspects to the hotel too. ####[['the staff are pretty nice', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The shower is big and the water pressure is good', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Decent place to work as well , because of the good Wi Fi', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hotel itself is quite a nice looking building', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The price was amazing', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Really incredibly cheap for what you get', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet , there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Overall it was just not relaxing or comfortable', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['my experience here was dreadful', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["I can ' t hold anything against the staff", 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['since there are positive aspects to the hotel too', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["I ' m not sure if it was a residential building as well , but there was a family staying on our floor that had two rooms , and left the door open between them , yelling very loudly in the hallway at all hours", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

1102,New hotel, ok location Quite simply, the hotel lied...about many things. Lie 1) I booked this hotel for my wife's birthday as it has a spa centre, as per the info on their website. There is NO operating spa centre. When I asked about this I was told it was still under construction and that if I wanted to book a spa we can walk around the corner. Lie 2) I'm training for a triathlon so when I saw that the fitness centre is open 24 hours, I thought great! The gym closes at 7pm and is NOT 24 hours. Also, the treadmills don't work. The belt stalls with each step so you can't even walk let alone run. And there are no sanitizing wipes, towels, bins or even access to water. Lie 3) The sunset bar looked great on their website, especially with the snacks and "signature cocktails" noted. There are NO cocktails and no snacks. And what the heck is the point of a pool and bar that closes at 7pm? I kept being told, not enough staff. Lie 4) The restaurant '12 Kitchen' is listed on their website as serving a buffet breakfast and dinner. There is NO dinner served and the breakfast closes at 9:30am. Lie 5) The hotel is listed on booking. com as 5 stars?! I'm not sure on which planet they got this rating but it is a 3 star at best. Definitely not an international standard 5 star. There is also, NO room service and nothing in the mini bar in the rooms. The rooms are ok, but...Upon arrival, the top shelves in the wardrobes were very dusty and we had to wipe them down before using them. The rooms were relatively clean but definitely not to a high standard. Housekeeping staff didn't even wash the glasses on a number of occasions. There is only a kettle with a couple of sachets of coffee issued. The toilets....oh the toilets...if you plan on using anything more than 3 individual squares of toilet paper, be prepared for a blocked toilet.

The tiled floor in the room looked spotless but under the bed there was all sort of rubbish (incl. a dead cockroach) that would fly around when the window was open. There is just one socket just on one side of the bed. The a/c pointed right at the bed head making very uncomfortable to sleep. The balcony was just 300mm deep, not made to sit outside nor hang your towel after being at the beach. The handrail was totally rusty. The view from every window of the building opens on the rubbish thrown in the perimeter land. The toliet sit is 5fingers smaller than the toilet itself. Shower water runs weak but it works incl. hot water. Very poor breakfast incl. coffee, tea, bread, ham and some fruit. Some staff members din't speak english and they din't make any effort to understand me.

274,We stayed in one of the pool villas and it was amazing! It was like a spacious 1 bedroom apartment. The perfect way to end our 4 week stay in Vietnam. The buffet breakfast which was included in the price was without doubt the best we had, so much on offer. The pool was great. And the restaurant Blu Lobster is amazing, we ate there twice. Make sure you watch the sunrise as well, stunning. One small complaint, they were unable to give us a complimentary 2pm checkout, so we booked the hotel shuttle to take us to the airport at 1 for a 3. 45 flight. The man then told us we dont need that much time to be at the airport. And tried pushing us back to 2. We compromised for 1. 45. But had to sit in the lobby bored out of our minds, at least at the airport there are things to look at and we could have got lunch. And I like to mot be rushed at the airport Always go with what you want.

138323,absolutely gorgeous, even better in real life - felt like a boutique-y four seasons. the bar on the top floor was beautiful and all of the food at the restaurant fantastic. whoever designed or built the hotel is clearly a world traveler with impeccable taste. gym was really nice too (did not take advantage of the spa) service was great except at the pool - constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the (quite large) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don’t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down. It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting, you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes. Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment, you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot (or didn’t understand because of language barrier?). Then by then the food is cold. Frequently saw 2-3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention. Also, the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours (this was a Monday afternoon) stirring up lots of insects. Why isn’t this done early morning or evening when there are less people trying to enjoy the pool? If it weren’t for the pool experience being unpleasant, I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation. Because of this, I don’t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn’t enjoyable to sit by the pool. But we still would come back for the rooms, gym and food. ####[['absolutely gorgeous , even better in real life', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['all of the food at the restaurant fantastic', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the bar on the top floor was beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['felt like a boutique - y four seasons', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['gym was really nice too', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['service was great except at the pool', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the ( quite large ) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don ’ t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting , you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment , you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Then by then the food is cold', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Frequently saw 2 - 3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['stirring up lots of insects', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I don ’ t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn ’ t enjoyable to sit by the pool', 'Loyalty', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['But we still would come back for the rooms , gym and food', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['If it weren ’ t for the pool experience being unpleasant , I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation', 'Branding', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

We had an evening meal after a long day out and it was exceptional, lots of menu choices, beautifully presented and very delicious. The hotel explains that whilst it is in a convenient part of the city, the views and space are not as good as the larger hotels but it makes up for that by providing excellent care and dedication and believe me that is exactly what they do. Nothing is too much trouble and all the staff go the extra mile to make your stay pleasurable. There was nothing to dislike once you realise how difficult it can be to have rooms with views. ####[['The staff at the Solaria Hotel were absolutely wonderful , everyone was kind , helpful and friendly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['was at the front of the hotel with a french balcony overlooking the road', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The reception area was comfortable', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the dining room on floor 8 was bright and airy', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['breakfast had a good choice of fruit , yogurt , pastries and bread and a choice of cooked eggs', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We had an evening meal after a long day out and it was exceptional , lots of menu choices , beautifully presented and very delicious', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['by providing excellent care and dedication and believe me that is exactly what they do', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the views and space are not as good as the larger hotels but it makes up for', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['it is in a convenient part of the city', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['all the staff go the extra mile to make your stay pleasurable', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was nothing to dislike once you realise how difficult it can be to have rooms with views', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]
139072,Very picturesque location. Rooms were lovely. Swimming pool was nice. Free bicycles for use and scooters to rent at a very good price. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. The young lady working there on reception, sorry I don’t know her name, was exceptionally helpful. She arranged transport to our hotel in Hanoi and seemed to be helping with absolutely everything. The communal facilities could be nicer. Everything looks very nice but some comfortable chairs rather than benches in the restaurant would encourage people to linger as the location is lovely ####[['Very picturesque location', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Rooms were lovely .
