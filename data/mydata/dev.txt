The taxi system between Sapa and the hotel was a bit time-consuming and expensive (200k VND each way), the driver is sometimes busy with other passengers, so it can take 20+ minutes until you're picked up.

403,Best hotel we have been to in Vietnam! It’s intimate, well designed and the hospitality of the staff is really next level. Special shout-out to Dora who was always ready to give tips and start a small conversation during breakfast. Also the fact that the general manager Sophia was very often on the workfloor gives a true sense of wellbeing and being noticed as a guest (they know your first name as from day one). Many more staff we could mention (also staff who were really forthcoming in arranging (free) bikes).In Short, the staff really made our stay memorable!

19,The location was great, a big yet quiet street, close to the city centre and other good local restaurants. We stayed in an 8-bed dormitory room, yet there was still enough space left to place our luggages and sit around. The bunk bed was far large enough for 1 person to roll around, power outlet and curtain were equiped for each single bed, which was a big plus. The host was super hospitable and helpful. You can always ask her for the guidance to anywhere around Cao Bang. She even accepted our late check out request when our car only arrived at 2pm. If you need more slippers or change the towels, they could always support. It would be better if there is more dust bin inside the room. There was only 1 in the bathroom when we stayed. There were still some dust/ cloth dust on our beds/ bedsheets when we arrived. Apart from that, all were great.####[['The location was great', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['close to the city centre and other good local restaurants', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The bunk bed was far large enough for 1 person to roll around', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['power outlet and curtain were equiped for each single bed', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The host was super hospitable and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['You can always ask her for the guidance to anywhere around Cao Bang', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['She even accepted our late check out request when our car only arrived at 2pm', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' If you need more slippers or change the towels , they could always support', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['It would be better if there is more dust bin inside the room', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['some dust / cloth dust on our beds / bedsheets', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['We stayed in an 8 - bed dormitory room , yet there was still enough space left to place our luggages and sit around', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['a big yet quiet street', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

Sometimes, after silently chasing a gibbon family by following their sound, we stayed at the same spot for 15 minutes just to watch their activity. That time we feel like we are a part of the jungle.

138760,The pool was nice. The location (close to the night market) was also good. I would really not recommend this hotel. We are by no means picky people and have travelled extensively, but this is one of the worst hotels we have ever encountered in terms of price/quality. The room was not cleaned before our arrival (two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it, thus also no clean towels. The place did not only have cockroaches upon arrival, but we kept encountering them. Although we know this might just be the climate, we did not encounter them anywhere else during 3 weeks in Vietnam. The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up, which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm. The water pressure was almost non existent. The airconditioning did not work most of the time. Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible. The staff did not speak a word of English. We had to communicate via Google translate. Overall, this place calls itself a resort, but in comparison with some of the significantly lower priced homestays or other hotels we had throughout three weeks in Vietnam, we would barely call this place a hotel and definitely not a resort. The sun was not present during our 3 days in Phu Quoc, but the 'cosy' part of 'suncosy' was even more absent than the sun.####[['The pool was nice', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' The location ( close to the night market ) was also good', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['I would really not recommend this hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['The room was not cleaned before our arrival ( two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom ), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it , thus also no clean towels', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up , which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' The water pressure was almost non existent .', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The airconditioning did not work most of the time', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The staff did not speak a word of English .

139620,The location is central, there is a supermarket nearby, nice Banh-Mi-Stands around the corner and a coffee shop closeby (E-Coffee). There were toilet amenities (soap, TP, toothbrush). The AC was working and quiet. We booked this hotel. We arrived after a long journey, and a sign was saying: we send you a message with all booking infos to self check-in. Said message never arrived. I contacted the responsible, who was quick to answer: we have issues with the climate control we have to rebook you to another location. That's how we got to Supertramp. Funny thing: it happened to another lady while we were there and she told us they rebooked her because the other one was full. This hotel looks way nicer than the other - which is why we think it's a scam. Now, reading other reviews, I realized it happened before. Coming to Supertramp:It's a construction site!At first we got offered a room with no window, which was not what we booked. They showed us another room, which we took. The room contained a kitchen and a washing-maschine (both not working) and a bed. The room was so tiny that we couldn't put our bags on the ground. Why do you put a not functioning kitchen+machine if there is no space already?!The cupboards were moist, some dirty towels were roting in them. The room was dirty. I made the mistake of looking behind the bed and in the cupboard - so much dirt, dust and spiderwebs. The walls are quite thin and not soundproof, so we heard everything (from neighbors to elevator and construction work).We wanted to pay online, but they didn't accept it: only cash. As we just arrived, we didn't have VND yet and explained that we would contact them as soon as we did and pay the bill. We stayed 3 days. Within the first day we got contacted 3 times to ask for the money (even though we previously made an agreement).

831,Pool area was really nice, rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable. I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer. Staff very friendly. After ordering a sandwich the bar tender took my payment card away to reception, I presumed to bring a card machine or to swipe my card at reception. There was some misunderstanding and I thought he was asking for my room number but sometime later I got a failed chip and pin attempt notification, he had exceeded the amount of pin attempts and my card was permanently blocked! After several correspondence with my bank about how to unblock it I found out that: The card can only be unblocked in the U. K. For the rest of the trip I was unable to use my card!He probably was trying to provide extra service and be helpful, or maybe it is a cultural difference but in the U. K. no one would ever give their PIN number to someone else, especially a staff member or stranger so we would never even suspect that a member of hotel staff was asking for a PIN number and not a room number. I was annoyed to say the least and even asked them to remove the service charge. At the end they still kept the charge on and I even added somesmall tip because felt bad for the guy who made a mistake, he did also give me a complimentary cola. Though if this happened in Europe at a luxury hotel or resort the sandwich would have lest been complimented in full. Be very careful and never let anyone walk away with your card! I was also fortunate that I had another card still within free withdrawal limits for the trip.####[['Pool area was really nice , rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' Staff very friendly', 'Service', 'Positive']]

138933,One word : AMAZING. This place looks like paradise on earth. Let me tell you everything you have to know about it. 1/ Moc Home is A Big house, with a pool, and a garden in the most beautiful mountains of Vietnam . I arrived at night so I could not see the landscape but when I woke up and look throw the window I was shocked about how beautiful the place was. The house in itself is super convenient and if you go to the first floor you can have a wonderful view. There are many comfortable sits that allow you to take a nap while watching those famous rice fields. 2/ The owner, Emma, who can speak English, has been absolutely lovely with me ! She helped me in so many ways and made me feel at home which is a wonderful feeling when you are far away from your country. You can ask her to help you to plan your future destination (call a taxi, car etc….) which is super useful especially in Vietnam. 3/ Everything is super clean : the bathrooms, toilets, kitchen, rooms, beds etc so it feels like you are in a really nice hotel. 4/ The food was delicious so I recommend you to eat there from time to time (the breakfast (I have chosen pancakes) was really good and the cooker prepared the best tomato tofu of my life.####[[' This place looks like paradise on earth', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Moc Home is A Big house , with a pool , and a garden in the most beautiful mountains of Vietnam ', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' I was shocked about how beautiful the place was', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The owner , Emma , who can speak English , has been absolutely lovely with me !

576,All of the staff was super nice and very responsive to our needs.

The hotel is a 10-min walk from the city center and there are only 6 rooms, which makes it quieter at night. We could also use the shared kitchen to cook our baby meals. Only Nhi and his girlfriend speak good English, so it can be difficult to get understood with the others. I think it’s part of the experience and enjoy that, but be warned.

Phoung and his lovely wife took so well care of me, they treat their guests literally like family. I initially wanted to stay only one night as a stop over coming from Sapa, heading to Hanoi. However I liked it so much instantly, that I decided to stay 2 nights. The freshly cooked breakfast and dinner, eaten together with the family, was the best meals I have had in Vietnam. Phoung brought me on a boat trip on Thac Ba Lake, which was amazing. In the evening he brought me and one other guest from India to play volleyball and dance together with his wife and her friends in the village.

972,The porter was helpful. We’d paid extra for a hotel taxi to the airport thinking it’d be more reliable and comfortable than a grab taxi. But the receptionist had forgotten to book it for us, and in the last moment, booked a Grab taxi which was less than half the price we’d paid. We could’ve done it ourselves. Didn’t expect much from the hotel because of its price. But the rooms are old, the walls were slightly dirty and peeling off in some places, the sofa in our room looked like a 90s relic, there was only one plug point in the room and we couldn’t get the air-con to work. We really liked its location, though.

946,Everything. A suggestion for improvement would be to have a second card to access the room. if travelling in a group, this may be of inconvenience if you decide to return to the hotel at different times. Another suggestion for improvement (unless I missed it) would be to have a leaflet by the hotel to keep with useful local information. Finally, we booked a free walking tour with Yam and Dong through Tripadviser. It would be great if the hotel can create a partnership with them for guests who would like a guided tour (English speaking) to explore Hanoi. Yam and Dong were so kind and truly amazing tour guides. If used, please kindly tip them for all their efforts!####[['A suggestion for improvement would be to have a second card to access the room', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['if travelling in a group , this may be of inconvenience if you decide to return to the hotel at different times', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['Yam and Dong were so kind and truly amazing tour guides', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' It would be great if the hotel can create a partnership with them for guests who would like a guided tour', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['would be to have a leaflet by the hotel to keep with useful local information', 'Service', 'Neutral']]

138861,Comfortable bed. Clean rooms. Great location. Pool was nice. Brutal check out experience. They advertise 24 hour reception so I thought nothing of checking out early in the morning to catch my 6 AM bus to the airport. There was nobody in reception except a security guard who, upon my spouse and I loading our bags onto the bus, proceeded to make a scene (yelling at myself and the driver) that I had yet to pay. I went inside to pay and found out he (security guard) could not administer payment. He had trouble getting ahold of the man in charge of reception. Meanwhile my bus driver was beginning to unload our things and was attempting to kick us off the bus as we were now behind schedule. I pleaded to him, explaining that the hotel had my credit info and I could be billed, and made the same plea to the security guard. To no avail. I was now refusing to get off the bus because I had a flight to catch, and caught between two men screaming at eachother and at me. I'm not sure I've faced that level of anxiety before in my life. All due to a false promise of 24 hour reception. Anyway, don't rely on the 24 hour reception, and don't expect to be treated with common decency by the staff (this doesn't apply to the guy working reception, he was actually kind and respectful).####[['Comfortable bed .

253,A Friend's Recommendation Unveils the Magic of Zizi Homestay in Sapa I am filled with immense excitement as I recount my extraordinary journey to the captivating landscapes of Sapa, Vietnam. Inspired by a friend's heartfelt recommendation, I embarked on a quest to discover the hidden treasures of this enchanting region. My adventure led me to the remarkable Zizi Homestay, and I can confidently say that it was an experience that exceeded all expectations—a journey that was truly worth every moment. Upon arriving at Zizi Homestay, I was instantly captivated by the beauty of its surroundings. Nestled amidst the awe-inspiring landscapes of Sapa, it stood as a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and culture. The gentle embrace of Zizi's warm hospitality and the sincere smiles of the Hmong people made me feel instantly at ease. It was evident from the very beginning that my friend's recommendation was a precious gift. The allure of Zizi Homestay extended far beyond its idyllic setting. It was a gateway to the vibrant tapestry of Hmong culture. With boundless enthusiasm, Zizi welcomed me into her world, eager to share the rich heritage and traditions of her community. I was invited to immerse myself in the fascinating art of batik dyeing, guided by the skilled hands of the Hmong artisans. It was a mesmerizing experience that allowed me to witness firsthand the intricate craftsmanship and the indomitable spirit woven into every stitch. Throughout my stay, Zizi proved to be an extraordinary hostess, going above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of my journey was filled with wonder and delight. From guiding me on breathtaking treks through the emerald rice terraces to introducing me to the flavors of traditional Hmong cuisine, Zizi's genuine care and passion created an atmosphere of true warmth and hospitality.####[]

140181,Staff was was super nice and accommodating. We booked the top floor apartment with sea view. Room was large and view was great.

Cafe downstairs makes great coffee and is open pretty late. We forgot to pay scooter rental at check out but Mr. Tran sent me an email and we settled the outstanding bill upon our return from a side-trip without penalty or other issue. Advertised as having in-room washer, but it did not, although it was still conveniently located in the stairwell in the hallway outside our room, and staff allowed us to use the dryer in the basement. Bathroom door did not stay closed on its own - we had to prop it closed with the garbage can. Bathroom walls could have used a good wipe down, and we noticed some ants in the kitchen area after cooking one night, but they were gone once the room was serviced and the garbage had been removed. They requested cash payment upon check-in although we booked with a card.####[['Staff was was super nice and accommodating', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Room was large and view was great', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Ours was the only room on the top floor , so we essentially had our own private roof top terrace and pool', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Cafe downstairs makes great coffee and is open pretty late .', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['We forgot to pay scooter rental at check out but Mr .

They ensured we took the best routes and went to the best locations, some of which weren’t full of tourists! We stayed in amazing home stays and ate great food which made the experience so much better.

1299,Staying at Hmong Sister House was a truly memorable experience. From the moment I arrived, I was struck by the warm and friendly atmosphere of the homestay. Lily, the hostess, was incredibly welcoming and made sure that I felt right at home. The homestay itself is a beautifully designed wooden house, filled with traditional Hmong crafts and artifacts. The surrounding natural landscape is breathtakingly beautiful, with rolling hills and lush forests stretching out in every direction. Even though the weather was a bit chilly during my stay, the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the house made me feel comfortable and relaxed. I loved the chance to learn more about Hmong culture and traditions during my stay, and appreciated Lily's insights and stories about her own experiences. Overall, I would highly recommend Hmong Sister House to anyone looking for a unique and authentic travel experience, and I can't wait to come back and visit again in the future.####[['Staying at Hmong Sister House was a truly memorable experience', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['From the moment I arrived , I was struck by the warm and friendly atmosphere of the homestay', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Lily , the hostess , was incredibly welcoming and made sure that I felt right at home', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The homestay itself is a beautifully designed wooden house , filled with traditional Hmong crafts and artifacts', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The surrounding natural landscape is breathtakingly beautiful , with rolling hills and lush forests stretching out in every direction', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Even though the weather was a bit chilly during my stay , the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the house made me feel comfortable and relaxed', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ["I loved the chance to learn more about Hmong culture and traditions during my stay , and appreciated Lily ' s insights and stories about her own experiences", 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' I would highly recommend Hmong Sister House to anyone looking for a unique and authentic travel experience', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ["I can ' t wait to come back and visit again in the future", 'Loyalty', 'Positive']]

138544,This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it's very near the Lake, the cute little streets, restaurants, night market, you name it. When you enter the hotel, you notice that the narrow entrance - which is normal for all hotels and houses in Hanoi - opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours, furniture and benches, and the most welcoming staff. Will, the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived, explained everything about the hotel and Hanoi as if he was a tour-guide, and he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits. Will is not the only gem in this hotel, as other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness, which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect. The hotel has a lift, a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby, the rooms have great beds (thank you) and a good lay-out for the space in an inner city hotel. It also has a lovely breakfast place (beautiful decoration) with good choices of food and drinks, and again great staff. However, one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the Skybar and roomservice is the best we had in Hanoi - by far. So we hope they create an inviting restaurant or rooftop eatery that creates a place for the chef to display her/his talents. Other good things to write about are the Spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff, and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place. Vietnam is colourful, and this is reflected in the interior design. We saw tourists stay here, as well as business people and locals, so we felt right at home. The hotel could possibly offer water refill-locations so less plastic is used, but it seems that Vietnam should tackle that problem in more hotels and locations.####[["This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it ' s very near the Lake", 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours , furniture and benches', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['and the most welcoming staff .

105,My family and I had a very comfortable stay at Hanoi Silk Centre hotel. The location is great. It’s in the centre of the old quarter but it’s peaceful and quiet inside. The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place. All the staff are so friendly, especially Ms Karathy and Jay. Ms Karathy booked our transfer from the airport, our trip to Ha Long Bay and was so helpful in making sure everything was sorted before we arrived. Jay made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to help us out. The day of our check out, the staff kindly allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel for the entire day until evening, when we picked up our bags to catch our overnight train to Hue. My dad accidentally left his medication in the hotel room and only realised when we got to the train station. We contacted the hotel and Jay assured us that he and the staff would find it, fortunately, they did find the medication and Jay hopped on his scooter to hand deliver the meds to us at the train station. We were so grateful that he went above and beyond and enabled us to enjoy the rest of our holiday. I hope the manager knows what fantastic staff they have, especially Ms Karathy and Jay.####[['The location is great', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['It ’ s in the centre of the old quarter but it ’ s peaceful and quiet inside', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['My family and I had a very comfortable stay at Hanoi Silk Centre hotel', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['All the staff are so friendly , especially Ms Karathy and Jay .

It's great value for money! The bathroom was connected to the one next door and so we could hear everything that the guests next door were saying. It's worth noting that two of the dogs are very friendly and like being petted, but two of them are not. We observed them snapping at/biting several other guests who went to touch them a couple of times.

When I arrived no one was there and it was impossible to communicate and find a solution via phone. Ended up taking a taxi.

1439,The property is converted from an old government office building to homestay. Its design is based on the concept of local ethnic groups in Sapa. You could see the owner put a lot of efforts on the design and materials used. Many recycled and traditional local ethnic group materials are used in the homestay. The staff were super helpful and friendly during my stay. They recommended some cafes with awesome view and try their best to fulfill my request. This homestay serve vegan food for lunch and dinner. I tried their local Vietnamese style began food and it was delicious. The chef has many years of working experience in hospitality line. She worked in 5-stars resorts in South East Asia and Middle East. As it was low season due to covid-19, the owner took extra mile by offering me a personal trip from Sapa to Y Ty when i asked him for tour package. It was a wonderful experience although the journey was not easy for me. In short, the price/night is considered under value (properly due to low season and covid-19) in view of the level of services provided by them.

139255,Great value. Perfect location. In the Old Quarter, but on a quieter street, I was able to sleep comfortably without being bothered by traffic noise.

139513,This was our favourite hotel in our honeymoon trip from North to South Vietnam. It’s a beautiful hotel and the staff are all incredibly helpful and courteous, really great service. I’m particular Binh on Reception and Vu the driver that took us on a day trip were lovely! Our junior suite room was so spacious and had everything you could wish for, it was truly lovely. They even had a coffee pod machine and provided decaf pods which was amazing for me as I had not been able to get decaf anywhere else! The gym is great with good facilities, we had a lovely massage at the spa, and the pool area is gorgeous it’s just such a shame we couldn’t enjoy it as the weather was sadly terrible for entire duration of our stay! Location is good too as although you are a good 20 min walk from Hoi An Old Town it makes this hotel a bit of a haven as you’re away from the hustle and bustle of the main area. I would definitely recommend this hotel it really is a beautiful place. Nothing we loved this place.####[['It ’ s a beautiful hotel', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' the staff are all incredibly helpful and courteous , really great service', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['I ’ m particular Binh on Reception and Vu the driver that took us on a day trip were lovely', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Our junior suite room was so spacious and had everything you could wish for , it was truly lovely', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['They even had a coffee pod machine and provided decaf pods which was amazing for me as I had not been able to get decaf anywhere else', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The gym is great with good facilities', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' we had a lovely massage at the spa', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['the pool area is gorgeous', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' it ’ s just such a shame we couldn ’ t enjoy it as the weather was sadly terrible for entire duration of our stay', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['Location is good too as although you are a good 20 min walk from Hoi An Old Town it makes this hotel a bit of a haven as you ’ re away from the hustle and bustle of the main area', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['I would definitely recommend this hotel it really is a beautiful place', 'Loyalty', 'Positive']]

138437,This was our best accomodation in Vietnam. There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses. There are small pools with fish and water flowers, it is like in a fairy-tale. I really recommend the place. Our bathroom was in the back of the house, outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle. Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also. We arrived in february and the weather was perfect. Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area. This is perfect for nature lovers. The room itself was clean and spacious. Clean towels and linen. The young ladies at the reception are welkoming and very helpful with everything you need. They organised transportation, help with motorcicle or motorbike rental, offer info and help with everything. They are very kind. They organised us the boat tour to floating market and arranged us the transportation to their places and then to the airport in Can Tho based on our group needs. Excellent comunication with them. The place is in the rural area near Can Tho so it is interesting to explore the villages by bicicle and see how people live, make an idea of how the life in around water canals. There is a local-style minimarket at walking distance from the accomodation. If you dont ride bicicle or motorbike the area might look a bit remote. We found no other place to eat at walking distance but we reached a small town at 6 km of bicicle ride with the help of google maps where you can find everything. We bought some exotic interesting fruits there in the fruit market and brought them at the accomodation and enjoyed them in the eating area. The boat tour on the canals and at the floating market revealed a lot of pollution. Plastic waste floating everywhere. It is very sad to see that. Otherwise it is interesting to see the trade at the floating market.####[['This was our best accomodation in Vietnam', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['There are small pools with fish and water flowers , it is like in a fairy - tale', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I really recommend the place', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['Our bathroom was in the back of the house , outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area .
