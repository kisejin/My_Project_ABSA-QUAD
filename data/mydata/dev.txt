138475,They were all very nice, and the hotel is really central. We arrived late at night, so we asked for a transfer from the airport. The lady was very nice to us, but we realised that we would pay 400. 000 vd, which is a lot for this transfer from the airport. (If we had gone by taxi, we would pay only around 130. 000 vd...) When we got to the hotel, a really nice man was there to receive us. The small room that we booked had no windows, so we upgraded to the bigger room. The hotel is OK, not fancy (we have to watch out for the cockroachs), but it's really central, and we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night, and also the air-conditioning machine outside (which is normal in Vietnam). When we were leaving, we asked the man if he could please call a taxi, and we expected no more fees from the hotel. Until we realised that the lady came to collect our money, saying that her car would take us to the airport (for 220. 000 vd). Of course, it was not her car, and she paid the taxi and got a fee from our money. We're not sure how much she paid the taxi, but it should be around 120. 000 vd, and the rest of the 100. 000 vd went to her pocket. It wasn't correct of her, and we felt robbed. I'd definitely not recommend this hotel, and if you do stay there, ALWAYS GET A TAXI YOURSELF, or give the extra money to the person that actually drives you.. ####[['They were all very nice', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['the hotel is really central', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The lady was very nice to us', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['but we realised that we would pay 400 . 000 vd , which is a lot for this transfer from the airport', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['When we got to the hotel , a really nice man was there to receive us', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' The small room that we booked had no windows , so we upgraded to the bigger room', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The hotel is OK , not fancy ', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night , and also the air - conditioning machine outside', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], [' we realised that the lady came to collect our money , saying that her car would take us to the airport ( for 220 . 000 vd ).

139950,The room/bungalow was beautiful, I loved the view and the swimming pool. Breakfast/dinner was great as well. Very friendly staff. The location outside of Sapa is much nicer than staying at a hotel in downtown Sapa, which is extremely touristy and busy. Overall I'd book this hotel again! The taxi system between Sapa and the hotel was a bit time-consuming and expensive (200k VND each way), the driver is sometimes busy with other passengers, so it can take 20+ minutes until you're picked up.

1580,The room was comfortable and clean, and the pool was very nice (apart from the rubbish at the bottom). It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi’s are available to get into town. The cleaning staff were very friendly. The staff weren’t helpful - there is a clear lack of management. The pool bar wait times are ridiculous, 1. 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water, 1. 5 for food as well. On our first 2 days the wait wasn’t as bad but there was only one person, the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long. The food and drink is also very overpriced (western prices) and very average. The laundry service is ridiculously expensive, we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear! There is no local advice available from the staff. We weren’t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren’t offered the welcome drink they advertise. Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment. The breakfast is constantly running out, and even if all the food and drink is available, there are no cups or plates to use! The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover, there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it. Overall, this is a 3 star experience, but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it’s a good option. ####[['The room was comfortable and clean , and the pool was very nice ', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi ’ s are available to get into town', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The cleaning staff were very friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The staff weren ’ t helpful - there is a clear lack of management', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The pool bar wait times are ridiculous', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['1 . 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water , 1 . 5 for food as well', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['On our first 2 days the wait wasn ’ t as bad but there was only one person , the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long', 'Service', 'Negative'], [' The laundry service is ridiculously expensive , we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The food and drink is also very overpriced', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['and very average', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['There is no local advice available from the staff', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['We weren ’ t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren ’ t offered the welcome drink they advertise', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The breakfast is constantly running out , and even if all the food and drink is available , there are no cups or plates to use', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover , there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['this is a 3 star experience , but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it ’ s a good option', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

The cruise was not busy and so we had the chance to be upgraded to their best suite, for free! Views were absolutely incredible from that room. The food in the evening is also good, attention to the details was appreciated. Highly recommend this company, as it is one of our highlights of our trip.

But the new room had as the staff phrased it “partly city view” and then hen pointed at one building at the very right corner of the window and said “that building is in the city”.. still no city view as we where used to when you book a suit with city view.

In the heart of the old quarter just off the busy beer street so it is very hectic but your close to everything. if your looking for something a bit out and less noisy maybe this isn’t for you but other than that the location is great it’s of a very very busy street so it’s difficult to get taxis right at the door due to so many pedestrians. the hotel also didn’t take card which was a slight hassle on checkout due to rushing to the airport but it was all good we got there in the end but do have cash with you to pay ####[['lovely stay', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['very modern rooms seem to be recently renovated even the life and hallways seemed to be going through renovations', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['comfortable room with good amount of space too', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' In the heart of the old quarter just off the busy beer street so it is very hectic but your close to everything', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' it ’ s difficult to get taxis right at the door due to so many pedestrians', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['the hotel also didn ’ t take card which was a slight hassle on checkout due to rushing to the airport but it was all good we got there in the end but do have cash with you to pay', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], [' the location is great it ’ s of a very very busy street', 'Amenity', 'Positive']]
1783,I had an absolutely wonderful stay at this apartment. The location was amazing, with a plethora of authentic local food options just a 5-minute walk away. However, the highlight for me was the stunning pool, where I spent many relaxing moments and admired the beautiful surroundings. Additionally, sitting on the balcony and enjoying a drink was a delightful experience. Hannah, the host, was simply fantastic. She was incredibly kind and helpful throughout my stay, providing valuable suggestions on local attractions and activities. Thanks to Hannah's support, I had an incredible travel experience without any issues. I am genuinely satisfied with my stay and cannot wait to return. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone seeking a memorable vacation. Not only does it boast an excellent location, but it is also comfortable and well-equipped. I had plenty of space to relax and make the most of my holiday. The balcony offered a lovely spot to take in the scenery and enjoy breakfast or an evening beverage. Nothing! ####[['I had an absolutely wonderful stay at this apartment', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' The location was amazing , with a plethora of authentic local food options just a 5 - minute walk away', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['the highlight for me was the stunning pool', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['where I spent many relaxing moments', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['admired the beautiful surroundings', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['sitting on the balcony and enjoying a drink was a delightful experience', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Hannah , the host , was simply fantastic', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['She was incredibly kind and helpful throughout my stay , providing valuable suggestions on local attractions and activities', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['I had an incredible travel experience without any issues', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' cannot wait to return', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['I am genuinely satisfied with my stay', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['I highly recommend this apartment to anyone seeking a memorable vacation', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], [' it boast an excellent location', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['also comfortable and well - equipped', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The balcony offered a lovely spot to take in the scenery and enjoy breakfast or an evening beverage', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' I had plenty of space to relax and make the most of my holiday', 'Facility', 'Positive']]
105,My family and I had a very comfortable stay at Hanoi Silk Centre hotel. The location is great. It’s in the centre of the old quarter but it’s peaceful and quiet inside. The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place. All the staff are so friendly, especially Ms Karathy and Jay. Ms Karathy booked our transfer from the airport, our trip to Ha Long Bay and was so helpful in making sure everything was sorted before we arrived. Jay made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to help us out. The day of our check out, the staff kindly allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel for the entire day until evening, when we picked up our bags to catch our overnight train to Hue. My dad accidentally left his medication in the hotel room and only realised when we got to the train station. We contacted the hotel and Jay assured us that he and the staff would find it, fortunately, they did find the medication and Jay hopped on his scooter to hand deliver the meds to us at the train station. We were so grateful that he went above and beyond and enabled us to enjoy the rest of our holiday. I hope the manager knows what fantastic staff they have, especially Ms Karathy and Jay. ####[['The location is great', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['It ’ s in the centre of the old quarter but it ’ s peaceful and quiet inside', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['My family and I had a very comfortable stay at Hanoi Silk Centre hotel', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['All the staff are so friendly , especially Ms Karathy and Jay .

It's probably a 2 star equivalent in Europe with a 3 or 4 star shower. Would suit a long stay. Like a month to really emmerse in the city or if you had studies to do. Would recommend this hostel/hotel. They take visa and card payments which is great option. Like most things really at this price point. But only thing really was the door to my room number 5 on 4th floor, was a little battered and slight cracks and gaps could be seen. But it did lock! The other doors seemed in better shape.

The hotel owner was also lovely, she even gifted us on departure, which is a beautiful and very appreciated gesture .The team of staff are very small and we’re mostly all lovely. The rooms were beautiful and way above the standard of what we paid. Breakfast was good there were both western and plenty of Vietnamese options, but the fruit selection in the morning was always fresh and plentiful. The staff always ask if you want anything special cooked for breakfast and went out of their way to order us yummy pho for breakfast (they don’t usually have this on the menu. The pool is actually bigger than what we expected and was made great use of during the hot Hoi An summer heat . Overall excellent value for money There wasn’t a lot to fault about this hotel. If I have to be picky, it was probably further away from market then we imagined. But it was extremely hot when we were there,and we aren’t game enough for motorcycles, so it may have felt further away then it was . Vihn (I think that’s his name , the only male front concierge) can work on his customer service skills.

The rooms are spacious, nice and cosy, good smell, and the beds are super comfortable. I really liked the storage arrangment. I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that! The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom. First, it was located on the bottom floor seperated from all the rooms in the hostel. The way there is exposed with no ceiling. On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom. I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way. The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well. As it is raining quite often in Sapa I think that's a problem... also there's only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel. Another thing to mind is the location - it's about 10-15 min. climb up the hill from town. It's not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather. ####[["The hostel ' s staff is one of the nicest and kindest I ' ve met during my travesl", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They always take interest in you and are very patient and helpful , and give the hostel a homey feeling', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' The rooms are spacious , nice and cosy , good smell , and the beds are super comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I really liked the storage arrangment', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['The way there is exposed with no ceiling', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [" there ' s only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["Another thing to mind is the location - it ' s about 10 - 15 min", 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['climb up the hill from town', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], [" It ' s not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather", 'Experience', 'Negative']]

544,Nice looking room, spacious with a bath. Our mistake not to check but about 1. 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started. This is a really noisy place, the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning (5. 30am) people using power tools. There are rodents in the roof. The bathroom looks great but the water doesn't flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over. The bath is really nice, but the hot water only fills about 1/5 of it at a time. Not that we would have used it, as it was too cold, but the pool was empty. Staff at reception were unwelcoming, didn't provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don't speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also, so made it hard to communicate at all. An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren't asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine, but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc. let alone wanted something else. We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves. When we realised this wasn't going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out. We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left. No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty because the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were 'unlaunderable' and had to pay 180,000 dong to replace them! So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins. So, this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam and don't recommend it at all. If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access. ####[['Nice looking room , spacious with a bath', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Our mistake not to check but about 1 . 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['This is a really noisy place , the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['people using power tools', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['There are rodents in the roof', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The bathroom looks grea', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["the water doesn ' t flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The bath is really nice', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the hot water only fills about 1 / 5 of it at a time', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Not that we would have used it , as it was too cold , but the pool was empty', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["Staff at reception were unwelcoming , didn ' t provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don ' t speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also , so made it hard to communicate at all", 'Service', 'Negative'], ["An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren ' t asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine , but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc . let alone wanted something else", 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["When we realised this wasn ' t going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out", 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [" the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were ' unlaunderable ' and had to pay 180 , 000 dong to replace them", 'Branding', 'Negative'], [' So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["don ' t recommend it at all", 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], [' If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access', 'Amenity', 'Negative']]

138861,Comfortable bed. Clean rooms. Great location. Pool was nice. Brutal check out experience. They advertise 24 hour reception so I thought nothing of checking out early in the morning to catch my 6 AM bus to the airport. There was nobody in reception except a security guard who, upon my spouse and I loading our bags onto the bus, proceeded to make a scene (yelling at myself and the driver) that I had yet to pay. I went inside to pay and found out he (security guard) could not administer payment. He had trouble getting ahold of the man in charge of reception. Meanwhile my bus driver was beginning to unload our things and was attempting to kick us off the bus as we were now behind schedule. I pleaded to him, explaining that the hotel had my credit info and I could be billed, and made the same plea to the security guard. To no avail. I was now refusing to get off the bus because I had a flight to catch, and caught between two men screaming at eachother and at me. I'm not sure I've faced that level of anxiety before in my life. All due to a false promise of 24 hour reception. Anyway, don't rely on the 24 hour reception, and don't expect to be treated with common decency by the staff (this doesn't apply to the guy working reception, he was actually kind and respectful). ####[['Comfortable bed .

138683,The apartment is modest in size but sufficiently facilitated. There are enough amenities for either business or vacation short stay. My favorite things are probably the modern wooden interiors and the staff being quite helpful. Although there is a swimming pool in Vinhomes park, I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for some relaxing swimming time. Apart from the additional fee, entrance requires a resident's approval which was quite a hassle, we had to contact Merry House's staff and waited outside the pool for 15 minutes until they got someone to let us in. Furthermore, the pool was swarmed with local residents and the changing rooms smelt awful. ####[['There are enough amenities for either business or vacation short stay', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ['the modern wooden interiors', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' the staff being quite helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], [" I wouldn ' t recommend it", 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['the pool was swarmed with local residents and the changing rooms smelt awful', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

Luckily for us, we had time. The location is great and we used this hotel as a base as we did 1-3 day trips around Hanoi. They were great with communication and super accommodating. Highly recommend as a good accomodation for the cost. Hotel construction started at 7:30-11am and we weren't warnded/informed. They were very apologetic about it and we are totally understanding as they have to do it at some point. It would just be considerate to let guests know beforehand (and I have given this same feedback on their checkout form).Still, the room is nice and I would come back to stay here!

I realised that I made booking with an individual owner, not with the hotel which means any issue you have to deal directly with the owner, not the hotel staff. The staff from the owner came without notice, ring the bell and ask to pay the bill. She admitted her mistake of not providing a double bed and reduced the payment. regardless I couldn’t sleep. This room includes breakfast but be aware that it’s not hotel breakfast!!!! They take you to a local eatery for breakfast. The owner poorly communicates so the restaurant staff asked me to pay for the meal.

139572,Bamboo Farmstay is where I enjoyed the most authentic Vietnamese hospitality experience of my entire trip. The owner, Nam, his sister, and the entire family were extremely kind, attentive, and caring throughout our stay. Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh, but I insisted on paying for it, as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me. Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex, a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future. I highly recommend visiting this area now, before the crowds descend. Nam's farmstay is a hidden gem, and I'm glad I chose it over other homestays that were located in a cramped area with a challenging road. This farmstay, on the other hand, is situated on a good road, close to the main thoroughfare that leads to two of Ninh Binh's main attractions: the pagoda and the river tour. The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent, and the Vietnamese cuisine they serve is simply delicious. Although they normally close at 9 PM, they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry. While the rooms are quite basic, they offer air conditioning and hot showers, and for the price, they are an unbeatable deal - under $10 per night! You'll also have the chance to stay in a charming bamboo bungalow, which is a real treat. All in all, I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future. I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience. ####[['The owner , Nam , his sister , and the entire family were extremely kind , attentive , and caring throughout our stay', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh , but I insisted on paying for it , as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex , a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['I highly recommend visiting this area now', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Although they normally close at 9 PM , they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['While the rooms are quite basic , they offer air conditioning and hot showers , and for the price , they are an unbeatable deal - under $ 10 per night', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], [' I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience', 'Loyalty', 'Positive']]
1543,Very friendly staff in a incredibly located hotel in the heart of the Old Quarter. Breakfast was good with a good buffet selection and additional items such as omlettes and pancakes for ordering. The location despite being great is right at the end of the night market which means on a Friday night it is incredibly noisy. The hotel is also split into two so we went to the wrong hotel first - but they are only about 20 metres apart so not a big issues though we also had to go to the other hotel for breakfast, We were on the 7th floor and had to take an incredibly slow lift to the 6th floor and then stairs to the 7th - worth considering if you have mobility issues. Note as well we were upgraded to a room with a balcony and view but unfortunately the room was like a goldfish bowl with windows all around and curtains that didn't cover the windows well meaning a lot of bright light came in from the streetlights and night market. ####[['Very friendly staff in a incredibly', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' located hotel in the heart of the Old Quarter', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' Breakfast was good with a good buffet selection and additional items such as omlettes and pancakes for ordering', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The location despite being great is right at the end of the night market', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' on a Friday night it is incredibly noisy .', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['The hotel is also split into two so we went to the wrong hotel first - but they are only about 20 metres apart so not a big issues though we also had to go to the other hotel for breakfast , We were on the 7th floor and had to take an incredibly slow lift to the 6th floor and then stairs to the 7th', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], [' worth considering if you have mobility issues', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], [' Note as well we were upgraded to a room with a balcony and view', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [" windows all around and curtains that didn ' t cover the windows well", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['meaning a lot of bright light came in from the streetlights and night market', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

Location - whilst not the most central location, the host got us taxi's as we couldn't use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim! We also used Google maps and the local bus, which is very cheap and reliable! So I didn't find location as issue at all. My husband loved the free gym! Whilst we did love our stay I feel it necessary to talk about what we didn't like. This place doesn't know what it wants yo be! It's guests are mainly young English teachers who actually live there medium to long term, so it's their home! We felt a bit like we were staying in their house. They are young, and with that came lots of night time noise, and socialising with friends not guests of the homestay right under our window until 2am on a couple of occasions. I expect young people to be noisy, it's normal, but I felt at the cost to other guests. This is because the place is mixed with different types of guests, and doesn't really have a true identity. This mixed with a very hard uncomfortable bed equaled a major lack of sleep for me! However, we did still enjoy our booking, but I feel this feedback is necessary for mid age guests, where noise might be an issue. ####[['amazing use of space and a great meet and greet', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast - excellent , very fresh and different each day', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Laundry service - free and done for you , which is just great', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Location - whilst not the most central location', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], [" the host got us taxi ' s as we couldn ' t use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['My husband loved the free gym', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' we did love our stay', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['we did still enjoy our booking', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

138579,Great location, staff are amazing, new hotel with modern facilities. Breakfast was yummy with lots of options. An oasis in the middle of the city. Laundry was a little pricey which is common in hotels. The service was fast and of a high standard. If you're in a rush it's worth it otherwise use a local service. Tour desk seeds work as the options are limited. Ended up booking tours online. The city view room does not have much of a view as it is a small city.

1494,Wonderful time here! While trekking through the jungle, Mr. Co taught me how to use my sense to navigate and search in there.

1364,The sea is right in front of the resort, and it's a very quiet place to stay, so if those things appeal to you, I highly recommend it. My room's wifi was not working properly. The air conditioner did not cool the room sufficiently, so it was extremely hot, and water was leaking through the AC evaporator. The staff was pleasant and helpful, but communication was occasionally difficult due to their limited English level. For example, when I was in the taxi, the driver asked them in "Vietnamese" if I could exchange money in the hotel, because I live in Korea and had korean wons, and they said yes no problem, but when I arrived, they said I had to go to Saigon (mainland Vietnam) because they don't exchange korean won in Phu quoc, which I could had already done if I had known this.

1860,Breakfast had good range of choices. The location was close to places of interest. The room was of adequate size and facilities. Pleasant greetings and very good help with luggage and taxis. Breakfast cutlery was not easily accessible. Limited vegetarian food options. Only cows milk available, soy is helpful for many. Front entry to hotel has steep and potentially slippery steps. Bathroom shower had no door, just open, much water on the floor. Only one chair in room, too little for a couple and particularly if family visit. The safety box would work initially, but then would not open.

139586,This is the first bad review i’ve ever written so far. We booked this hotel because they should offer a buffet breakfast and they should also have a gym. But non of them was provided. There is also almost no breakfast possibilities in the sourroundings exept pho or seafood. We booked a deluxe room in a (apparently) 4 star hotel, but the room we more like a good budget doubleroom. The queensize bed was cozy, but iz was not one double bed but 2 single beds next to each other. The room was only cleaned once during the stay of 4 days. So in conclusion we would not recommend this hotel if you expect a little bit more comfort. ####[['We booked this hotel because they should offer a buffet breakfast and they should also have a gym .

140010,The location is amazing but it's busy and noisy around the streets, but quiet at night to sleep. The convenience store is next door, and massage shops and restaurants are all next door or within 50 meters. Beach is 300 meters away. The aircon is nice and very cold. The bed is soft but comfortable. Washing machine and clothes hangers and clothes rack are available. Big fridge is available. Motorcycles can be parked inside at nighttime. I stayed in 3 different rooms there. The sink in the bathroom was blocked in 2 of the rooms. The sofas are old and sometimes ripped. One room had stains on the blanket. Washing machine detergent is not supplied but can be bought next door at the convenience store for a few dollars. The view on the bottom floor rooms are terrible: you will see a brick wall etc. Nothing to look at. Better to close the curtains. Not "guest friendly". Guests in rooms are only allowed before 9pm.
