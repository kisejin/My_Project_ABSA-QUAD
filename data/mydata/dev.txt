662,The hotel is quite central, but for this price and value - so are a lot of other options! We booked a suite with city view on 25m2. The room was not 25m2 and the so called city view was a sump and a construction yard. After complaining the staff explained to us that “city view” means the room has a window as they also have rooms without window. We did not agree to this definition and they therefor changed room. But the new room had as the staff phrased it “partly city view” and then hen pointed at one building at the very right corner of the window and said “that building is in the city”.. still no city view as we where used to when you book a suit with city view. They explained to have a better or full city view we had to pay more…- shower is right over toilet, disgusting.. ####[['The hotel is quite central', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['but for this price and value - so are a lot of other options', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['The room was not 25m2', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the so called city view was a sump and a construction yard', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['After complaining the staff explained to us that “ city view ” means the room has a window as they also have rooms without window', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['But the new room had as the staff phrased it “ partly city view ” and then hen pointed at one building at the very right corner of the window and said “ that building is in the city ”.. still no city view as we where used to when you book a suit with city view', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['shower is right over toilet , disgusting', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['They explained to have a better or full city view we had to pay more', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['We did not agree to this definition and they therefor changed room', 'Service', 'Neutral']]

138475,They were all very nice, and the hotel is really central. We arrived late at night, so we asked for a transfer from the airport. The lady was very nice to us, but we realised that we would pay 400. 000 vd, which is a lot for this transfer from the airport. (If we had gone by taxi, we would pay only around 130. 000 vd...) When we got to the hotel, a really nice man was there to receive us. The small room that we booked had no windows, so we upgraded to the bigger room. The hotel is OK, not fancy (we have to watch out for the cockroachs), but it's really central, and we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night, and also the air-conditioning machine outside (which is normal in Vietnam). When we were leaving, we asked the man if he could please call a taxi, and we expected no more fees from the hotel. Until we realised that the lady came to collect our money, saying that her car would take us to the airport (for 220. 000 vd). Of course, it was not her car, and she paid the taxi and got a fee from our money. We're not sure how much she paid the taxi, but it should be around 120. 000 vd, and the rest of the 100. 000 vd went to her pocket. It wasn't correct of her, and we felt robbed. I'd definitely not recommend this hotel, and if you do stay there, ALWAYS GET A TAXI YOURSELF, or give the extra money to the person that actually drives you.. ####[['They were all very nice', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['the hotel is really central', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The lady was very nice to us', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['but we realised that we would pay 400 . 000 vd , which is a lot for this transfer from the airport', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['When we got to the hotel , a really nice man was there to receive us', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The small room that we booked had no windows , so we upgraded to the bigger room', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The hotel is OK , not fancy', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night , and also the air - conditioning machine outside', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['we realised that the lady came to collect our money , saying that her car would take us to the airport ( for 220 . 000 vd ).

The bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet, there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed, the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area. I'm not sure if it was a residential building as well, but there was a family staying on our floor that had two rooms, and left the door open between them, yelling very loudly in the hallway at all hours. Overall it was just not relaxing or comfortable. I can't hold anything against the staff, but my experience here was dreadful. I'm sorry.

Then I want to go to the pool, so I leave my room - but oh the keyroom reader on my door doesn’t work - turns out battery ran out! So I go to the lobby and ask the lobby guy to fix it. He promises to come back in a moment to do so, so I wait for him in my room. Doesnt show up. Had to go ask for it AGAIN the next day for this guy to do his work (of course no one at the reception figured that it would perhaps be a good idea to call me and let me know he wont show up using the room phone next to bed) And then to top it off, its about 3:10 am in the middle of the night and now the hotel room telephone built in next to my bed rings. I pick it up. Nothing. Well, thanks for giving me a call in the middle of the night smart person at the reception So yeah it wasnt a good stay.

138760,The pool was nice. The location (close to the night market) was also good. I would really not recommend this hotel. We are by no means picky people and have travelled extensively, but this is one of the worst hotels we have ever encountered in terms of price/quality. The room was not cleaned before our arrival (two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it, thus also no clean towels. The place did not only have cockroaches upon arrival, but we kept encountering them. Although we know this might just be the climate, we did not encounter them anywhere else during 3 weeks in Vietnam. The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up, which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm. The water pressure was almost non existent. The airconditioning did not work most of the time. Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible. The staff did not speak a word of English. We had to communicate via Google translate. Overall, this place calls itself a resort, but in comparison with some of the significantly lower priced homestays or other hotels we had throughout three weeks in Vietnam, we would barely call this place a hotel and definitely not a resort. The sun was not present during our 3 days in Phu Quoc, but the 'cosy' part of 'suncosy' was even more absent than the sun. ####[['The pool was nice', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The location ( close to the night market ) was also good', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['I would really not recommend this hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['The room was not cleaned before our arrival ( two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom ), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it , thus also no clean towels', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up , which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The water pressure was almost non existent .', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The airconditioning did not work most of the time', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The staff did not speak a word of English .

139362,Loved the value for money. To have your own room in district one not more than 10 min walk from walking street and the busy bar and restaurant area is super for the price. In a authentic Vietnamese alley and market street locale. Room was a good size. Air conditioning worked well and a nice bathroom. Good work space and table with chairs. View of the city. It's probably a 2 star equivalent in Europe with a 3 or 4 star shower. Would suit a long stay. Like a month to really emmerse in the city or if you had studies to do. Would recommend this hostel/hotel. They take visa and card payments which is great option. Like most things really at this price point. But only thing really was the door to my room number 5 on 4th floor, was a little battered and slight cracks and gaps could be seen. But it did lock! The other doors seemed in better shape. Thinking they could replace or repair this one. ####[['Loved the value for money', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['To have your own room in district one not more than 10 min walk from walking street and the busy bar and restaurant area is super for the price', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Room was a good size', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Air conditioning worked well and a nice bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Good work space and table with chairs', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['View of the city', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ["It ' s probably a 2 star equivalent in Europe with a 3 or 4 star shower", 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Would recommend this hostel / hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['They take visa and card payments which is great option', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['But only thing really was the door to my room number 5 on 4th floor , was a little battered and slight cracks and gaps could be seen', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

609,rien My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare. From the outset, the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous. The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic English. In a highly unprofessional move, he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking. com platform, promising “better apartments, better views, and more check-in options.” He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times! And after reading reviews from previous guests, I discovered that those who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn’t get any of the promised benefits. The deceit didn’t stop there. On the check-in day, the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower. This was a complete bait and switch, and it left us feeling utterly duped. To add insult to injury, the apartment itself was a disaster. The furniture was old, worn, and filthy, and the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online. It was smaller, older, and lacked any charm or modern decoration. The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding. As if that weren’t enough, the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay. We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water. It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard. In short, our stay at Landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism. I urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere. It’s simply not worth the stress, frustration, and betrayal. ####[['My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic Englis', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['In a highly unprofessional move , he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking . com platform , promising “ better apartments , better views , and more check - in options', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times !', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn ’ t get any of the promised benefits', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The deceit didn ’ t stop there', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['This was a complete bait and switch', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['it left us feeling utterly duped', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['the apartment itself was a disaster', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The furniture was old , worn , and filthy', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['It was smaller , older , and lacked any charm or modern decoration .', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['our stay at Landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['I urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['It ’ s simply not worth the stress , frustration , and betrayal', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

140239,Pretty much the perfect stay. This resort is pretty amazing. It's right on the ocean and has got a gigantic swimming pool with a bar in it and tons of comfy mattresses and long chairs to chill, enjoy the sun and read a book. The three restaurants on site are pretty good and the breakfast definitely wins it all. That buffet is the best way to start the day. Room was very comfy, great bed, spacious, clean and with the private pool it was just the cherry on top. But what made our stay even better was the staff. The whole staff team was absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel. If we really want to find a couple of things to improve, then it would be: - a bit more maintainance of the pool mattresses and long chairs which are showing a bit of fatigue.- the price of the restaurants which is a bit high. ####[["It ' s right on the ocean", 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['got a gigantic swimming pool with a bar in it and tons of comfy mattresses and long chairs to chill', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The three restaurants on site are pretty good', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['the breakfast definitely wins it all', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Room was very comfy , great bed , spacious , clean', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the private pool it was just the cherry on top', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['what made our stay even better was the staff', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The whole staff team was absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['a bit more maintainance of the pool mattresses and long chairs which are showing a bit of fatigue', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['the price of the restaurants which is a bit high', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['high', 'Service', 'Neutral']]

Makes for a very uncomfortable sleep. - Staff don’t speak English. - We asked for an iron. 20min later it arrived. The next morning around 6am we were woken by reception calling us to ask for the iron back. - Staff called our room while we were sleeping to ask if we paid our bill with cash or credit card. ####[['Location was great', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['We booked a double bed and when we arrived at the hotel we were told that is wasn ’ t available', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['No phone call prior to let us know before hand so we could cancel and find other arrangements', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['No shower head holder in the shower', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Shower gel and conditioner bottles were empty', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The “ king bed ” is actually just 2 single beds pushed together', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Makes for a very uncomfortable sleep', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['Staff don ’ t speak English', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['We asked for an iron . 20min later it arrived', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The next morning around 6am we were woken by reception calling us to ask for the iron back', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Staff called our room while we were sleeping to ask if we paid our bill with cash or credit card', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['I sent a message to the other hotel to ask if we could check in early', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['No reply', 'Service', 'Negative']]

831,Pool area was really nice, rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable. I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer. Staff very friendly. After ordering a sandwich the bar tender took my payment card away to reception, I presumed to bring a card machine or to swipe my card at reception. There was some misunderstanding and I thought he was asking for my room number but sometime later I got a failed chip and pin attempt notification, he had exceeded the amount of pin attempts and my card was permanently blocked! After several correspondence with my bank about how to unblock it I found out that: The card can only be unblocked in the U. K. For the rest of the trip I was unable to use my card!He probably was trying to provide extra service and be helpful, or maybe it is a cultural difference but in the U. K. no one would ever give their PIN number to someone else, especially a staff member or stranger so we would never even suspect that a member of hotel staff was asking for a PIN number and not a room number. I was annoyed to say the least and even asked them to remove the service charge. At the end they still kept the charge on and I even added somesmall tip because felt bad for the guy who made a mistake, he did also give me a complimentary cola. Though if this happened in Europe at a luxury hotel or resort the sandwich would have lest been complimented in full. Be very careful and never let anyone walk away with your card! I was also fortunate that I had another card still within free withdrawal limits for the trip. ####[['Pool area was really nice , rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Staff very friendly', 'Service', 'Positive']]

182,The facilities of the apartment are great. Brand new building. The studio I stayed has everything I needed except the hairdryer didn’t work. The swimming pool was stunning. The organisation and communication was poor!! I requested a double bed but I had twin room. I’m the person who can’t sleep on a tiny bed. I realised that I made booking with an individual owner, not with the hotel which means any issue you have to deal directly with the owner, not the hotel staff. The staff from the owner came without notice, ring the bell and ask to pay the bill. She admitted her mistake of not providing a double bed and reduced the payment. regardless I couldn’t sleep. This room includes breakfast but be aware that it’s not hotel breakfast!!!! They take you to a local eatery for breakfast. The owner poorly communicates so the restaurant staff asked me to pay for the meal. After a looooooooooong and frustrating conversations between hotel management, owner and restaurant staff, you will be told by the owner “I will pay”. That’s it. He just hang off the phone!!! This is the least thing you want to deal with before your morning flight! ####[['The facilities of the apartment are great', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Brand new building', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The studio I stayed has everything I needed except the hairdryer didn ’ t work', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The swimming pool was stunning', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The organisation and communication was poor', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['I requested a double bed but I had twin room', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The staff from the owner came without notice , ring the bell and ask to pay the bill .

138769,I traveled for a short weekend trip and the hotel and the room was okay for that. Communication with the staff was quite difficult in English. I has organized a transfer from the airport to the hotel as I arrived late in the evening and provided my flight info. I had written confirmation of a pick up. When I arrived no one was there and it was impossible to communicate and find a solution via phone. Ended up taking a taxi. Showering in the morning was no problem but in the afternoon there was no warm water. Breakfast is definitely focused on Asian tourism and limited if you are looking for continental style. It was not a problem for me but might be interesting to know for other travelers. The rooms are not very soundproof. You hear lots of noise from the hallways (maybe I was unlucky with the family next door). ####[['Communication with the staff was quite difficult in English', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Showering in the morning was no problem but in the afternoon there was no warm water', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Breakfast is definitely focused on Asian tourism and limited if you are looking for continental style .

139312,Everything! There is nothing not to love about The View. The location is stellar (in the middle of everything yet secluded enough to be quiet), the amenities are everything you need as a traveler to make it your home away from home, and the owners go above and beyond in any way they can to make your stay absolutely wonderful (you don’t even have to ask). And it’s just as nice as the pictures to boot! I use up all the positive adjectives in the dictionary to describe staying here and it wouldn’t be enough.

138879,It really was a great hideaway and base for exploring Ben Tre. It is located on the quieter side of the river and way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel. The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area. The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more. The homestay itself is cute and homely, with a small shared living space that you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions. The rooms are located just behind a little stream at the back and provides total quietness. Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them! We stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view. Internet is great and we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us. It was such a lovely place to get away from HCMC for a few days. It is a great value for price! The only inconvenience (that can be easily rectified) is that as it is in the outskirt of Ben Tre you cannot reach there by public transport from HCMC. The small taxi rides are absolutely worth being in the quietness and lush green surroundings! ####[['It is located on the quieter side of the river', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The homestay itself is cute and homely , with a small shared living space', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them !

I booked the first portion of our stay on booking. com at a discounted rate. The cost for 3 nights pre booked was the same cost as a 1 night extension that was booked at the hostel.

139759,Ideally located (10 minutes walk from Van Long nature reserve - however see negative comments below), exceptionally beautiful and well maintained grounds, excellent breakfast and the dining menu at the restaurant was very good. Rooms are more like private bungalows and were clean and comfortable. The resort, despite it's beautiful trimmings is not good value money - it's actually a greedy money grab. One particular incident left a very sour note for us. The Van Long nature reserve is literally 10 minutes walk away and the normal booking price at the ticketing office for a boatman is 70k per boat. The resort charged us over 200k per person for this "tour" for which all they did was save us the walk by dropping us with their golf cart. Their golf cart driver literally paid the ticketing office the basic fee and dropped us then came back it pick us up. So essentially we paid for the convenience of a 5 minute golf cart ride. I find this extremely greedy. A resort of this of this size should upfront be offering this information and/or even providing this drop off service for free to guests.

The cleaning service was very good, our towels were changed daily, rooms were cleaned and the water supplied daily.

The pool was ok. not too big though but it was refreshing to be able to use it after our short trips. It was very hot during our stay and the pool was a blessing. It was quiet and peaceful at night too. The coffee was good too! The location although very close to town is also in a close proximity to a rather noisy bridge - a metal crate bridge for scooters and you can hear the noise when you use the pool.

139620,The location is central, there is a supermarket nearby, nice Banh-Mi-Stands around the corner and a coffee shop closeby (E-Coffee). There were toilet amenities (soap, TP, toothbrush). The AC was working and quiet. We booked this hotel. We arrived after a long journey, and a sign was saying: we send you a message with all booking infos to self check-in. Said message never arrived. I contacted the responsible, who was quick to answer: we have issues with the climate control we have to rebook you to another location. That's how we got to Supertramp. Funny thing: it happened to another lady while we were there and she told us they rebooked her because the other one was full. This hotel looks way nicer than the other - which is why we think it's a scam. Now, reading other reviews, I realized it happened before. Coming to Supertramp:It's a construction site!At first we got offered a room with no window, which was not what we booked. They showed us another room, which we took. The room contained a kitchen and a washing-maschine (both not working) and a bed. The room was so tiny that we couldn't put our bags on the ground. Why do you put a not functioning kitchen+machine if there is no space already?!The cupboards were moist, some dirty towels were roting in them. The room was dirty. I made the mistake of looking behind the bed and in the cupboard - so much dirt, dust and spiderwebs. The walls are quite thin and not soundproof, so we heard everything (from neighbors to elevator and construction work).We wanted to pay online, but they didn't accept it: only cash. As we just arrived, we didn't have VND yet and explained that we would contact them as soon as we did and pay the bill. We stayed 3 days. Within the first day we got contacted 3 times to ask for the money (even though we previously made an agreement). In the end we got woken up by a random lady the next morning at 8a. m (she wouldn't stop knocking, spoke no English, just said "money,money". Nobody told us she would come and wake us up. I texted the responsible guy and told him this is not acceptable. On the same day in the evening I wanted to pay him, but it was too late. ####[['The location is central , there is a supermarket nearby', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['nice Banh - Mi - Stands around the corner and a coffee shop closeby ( E - Coffee )', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There were toilet amenities', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The AC was working and quiet', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['At first we got offered a room with no window , which was not what we booked', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['They showed us another room , which we took', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The room contained a kitchen and a washing - maschine ( both not working ) and a bed', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["The room was so tiny that we couldn ' t put our bags on the ground", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The cupboards were moist , some dirty towels were roting in them', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The room was dirty', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['I made the mistake of looking behind the bed and in the cupboard - so much dirt , dust and spiderwebs', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The walls are quite thin and not soundproof , so we heard everything', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [".

They understood what we were looking for (discovering local culture and beautiful landscape).

It is a quiet place with a nice garden.- Rooms are convenient, with everything needed - The restaurant is nice. We had some home made pizzas but also delicious home made Vietnamese meals with the family.

1558,Beautiful open see through lobby, lovely ocean view rooms with a balcony, superb breakfast buffet, wonderful staff and service, and a playroom for the kids with an attendant. The location is perfect, in the city but quieter when compared to the main road area. We ate at the restaurant several times, the seafood buffet was good, a la carte was really good too. The spa was lovely. We were very happy with our stay at Furama. It was great overall, we were very happy with our stay, difficult to find anything wrong. To note, for a family of 2 adults + 2 children, it would make sense to book an ocean view suite rather than take a garden view room. This is because when they say 2 twin beds, it means 2 single beds in the garden room which aren't useful for 2 adults and 2 kids. So you have to take an extra bed at an added cost. Hence for a similar price, take the ocean view room which come with 2 platform sofa's which can convert to 2 kids beds and a fantastic view! Mr. Tung at the reception was very helpful and friendly. ####[['Beautiful open see through lobby , lovely ocean view rooms with a balcony', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['superb breakfast buffet', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['wonderful staff and service', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['a playroom for the kids with an attendant', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The location is perfect , in the city but quieter when compared to the main road area', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['We ate at the restaurant several times , the seafood buffet was good , a la carte was really good too', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The spa was lovely', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['We were very happy with our stay', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['we were very happy with our stay , difficult to find anything wrong', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['for a family of 2 adults + 2 children , it would make sense to book an ocean view suite rather than take a garden view room', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['Mr .

We also got our loundry done (35000/kg) and we were able to stay an extra night even though we hadn't booked it. When we wanted to stay another extra night, the hotel was full, but he arranged us a room for the same price in the hotel next door. The room itself was very clean and comfortable.

Third morning, shower water was cold. Everything could be better. The name of this hotel is not the White House delux but the White House. Driver spent over half an hour trying to find this hotel because incorrect name. When we finally ascertained that the White House was the hotel that we booked, driver paid the staff out asking why was it called the White House delux, staff just laughed. Staff could not speak any english. Communication was poor. Often there was no one at reception. We booked a bus through reception for nha trang and were told it was going to leave at 8. 30am. We were told we could pay with credit card on leaving. We were told in four different times that the bus would leave at 8. 30am. In the morning when we were leaving we could not have a shower because the water was cold. When we got to reception at 7. 15am we were told that the bus was leaving at 7. 40 am. Then we were told that we had to pay the hotel and bus fare in cash. After finalising the bill the staff grabbed our bags and took off from the hotel and said we had to hurry for the bus. He then disappeared into the street somewhere with our bags. We could not see him anywhere. Finally we saw him up the road dragging our bags. Eventually we got to the bus and an argument between the driver and staff because we were late. When we arrived in nha trang we had notification from booking. com that we had stayed for two days instead of the three days that we had booked. We contacted booking. com who sorted this issue quickly. This hotel and staff appears to be dishonest.

139274,Location was great, away from the main road, so no traffic noise Plenty cheap local places to eat along the main street, as you come out of the guesthouse, Great communal areas above & at the side of the reception, with a bar & cafe, Not a fan of touristy stuff, so it was great to rent a good motorbike from the guesthouse & explore the Island for 3x days, well worth doing If you wanna see the "Real" markets walk down to the night market area & go over the bridge, that is where the "Real" Phu Quoc is, well worth exploring that area, which is not that far of a walk from the guesthouse I would certainly recommend this guesthouse ####[['Location was great , away from the main road , so no traffic noise', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Plenty cheap local places to eat along the main street , as you come out of the guesthouse', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Great communal areas above & at the side of the reception , with a bar & cafe', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['it was great to rent a good motorbike from the guesthouse', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['I would certainly recommend this guesthouse', 'Loyalty', 'Positive']]

The location is perfect, just a few steps away from the Main Street in Tam Coc, close to many restaurants and bars but still in a quiet area, without any noise. We could choose between some different breakfast options, which were always delicious and served with fresh fruits. A very big plus: We could rent bicycles for free which we used every day to explore the beautiful surroundings of Tam Coc. In our bathroom there was water leaking from the seeling.

1999,A wonderful and peaceful oasis in the busy area of Cai Be. As we know the only place right on the river. We had a river view bungalow and it was really fantastic to watch all the life floating on the water. Staff and restaurant are not very professional due to lack of English language. But they are working hard and try to improve constantly. The pool and spa area are nice and the rooms are well equipped. Can't imagine to find a better place in the area. The private boat tour we booked was not worth it. There is no more floating market in Cai Be. So if you want to see dirty houses and trash go for ot.
