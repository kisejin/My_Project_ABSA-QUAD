1966,lovely stay, very modern rooms seem to be recently renovated even the life and hallways seemed to be going through renovations. comfortable room with good amount of space too! In the heart of the old quarter just off the busy beer street so it is very hectic but your close to everything. if your looking for something a bit out and less noisy maybe this isn’t for you but other than that the location is great it’s of a very very busy street so it’s difficult to get taxis right at the door due to so many pedestrians. the hotel also didn’t take card which was a slight hassle on checkout due to rushing to the airport but it was all good we got there in the end but do have cash with you to pay ####[['lovely stay', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['very modern rooms seem to be recently renovated even the life and hallways seemed to be going through renovations', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['comfortable room with good amount of space too', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['In the heart of the old quarter just off the busy beer street so it is very hectic but your close to everything', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it ’ s difficult to get taxis right at the door due to so many pedestrians', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the hotel also didn ’ t take card which was a slight hassle on checkout due to rushing to the airport but it was all good we got there in the end but do have cash with you to pay', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the location is great it ’ s of a very very busy street', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

A clean and comfy couch was very welcome after 4 hours on a motorbike in 36+ deg heat riding across the red river delta.

The AC was so good it dried our clothes over night as it rained outside. The samsung washing machine was an excellent feature and the staff kindly gifted us some laundry liquid. The rest of the bathroom was well equipped and clean. The bed was comfortable and extra wide. The entire apartment was very clean and offered sweeping views across downtown Haiphong. Breakfast is a buffet with made to order Banh Da Cua (crab noodle soup) and eggs plus all the other bits you want, and great coffee.

This a wooden traditional house with wooden beams and clay roof tiles.

The balcony is huge and have traditionally solid wood chairs. The Homestay is surrounded with peaceful. So it is very interesting and to experience the Vietnamese traditional way of living.

1029,Our stay at Azerai was great. The staff were friendly and super attentive, and the facilities were nice and new. From the moment we were picked up, we were very well taken care of. One minor issue of an old razor being found in our room was made up for with a room upgrade. Food in the restaurant was good, albeit a little pricey but options in Can Tho were easy to access. The staff were great in recommending various places to visit. The highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local’s house while we waited for the rain to pass. Everything was super genuine and authentic - The guide, also a resort employee, grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing! Lastly the hotel transfer from Ho Chi Minh City was excellent - a comfortable limousine van which made the two hour trip each way enjoyable. Would recommend to visit, and stay in the Lake rooms. We started in the Garden Room, but the view from the Lake Room is better. If possible try avoid the weekends and local school holidays as the resort is much quieter.

139603,Location: 300-800m near buses, Co-Op mart, and 10-15 min walk to the main beaches. Personnel: the owner/receptionist is particularly annoying. 1. there is no price list. So she could charge anything, disregarding the Booking's price. if you don't agree she would put you in a small stuffy smoking-smelling room, not as in the picture advertised. You are not allowed to remove the tray. 2. there is no cup/glass, or kettle available to discourage eating or drinking in the room. She had a set mind and tried to rule you as much as possible such as locking away all remote controls in the draw, and telling me that" no need to touch /change them". 3. When I complained about the TV not working and the water from the basin leaking on the bathroom floor, she was very argumentative, trying to put the blame on me. Instead of examining the problems or being willing to fix the issues. She was loud and aggressive and disregarded anything I said or requested persistently. She would never stop talking, once she was in my room. 4. The first day when I arrived I gave her my ID, she did not have any question. After she got to know me in he afternoon, she asked me if I have money to lend her, I laughed and left. When I got back that night I told her that I was very sick. She did not care but kept dragging on questioning my ID , trying to cause me trouble. I was very tired and sick and she would not leave me alone. When I told her that I was willing to pack my bag and leave immediately (eventhough it was almost midnight). She then shut up, and let me go to rest. The next day, the Bell boy asked me nicely if I would stay another day as booked, and tried fixing the leaking basin. So I stayed and She left me alone since. 5. Everyday, room was not cleaned nor rubbished being collected so brought them down to reception bin, she made me to throw them outside the building site. Lastly, I forgot to collect my ID after settling the account. upon realising, I called and asked her nicely to send it to my address in Saigon. ####[['300 - 800m near buses , Co - Op mart , and 10 - 15 min walk to the main beaches', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['he owner / receptionist is particularly annoying', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["there is no price list .

Despite not being able to check into our room straight away (stayed 2 nights in another apartment as our apartment wasn't ready) - staff were quick to respond to our needs. We booked our room at least 3 months in advance - when we checked in we were informed our room wasn't ready and we had to stay in a temporary apartment for 2 nights. This temporary had no amenities (no kettle, no utensils, no bowls, not even a bin).

140115,the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish, the owner and the staff generally polite, friendly and helpful. i was offered free tea during check-in and check-out. good communication via whatsapp, the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in. on arrival my scooter was brought to a safe place and they also took care of my keys and gear. Unfortunately there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds. On arrival I was warned of the nocturnal noise from the street - to be fair, before paying. However, the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs, even the mattress vibrated (and that was on the 4th floor, not directly at the street and on a tuesday) - not the hotels fault, but guests should be aware of this. After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff, they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel (30k) saying it couldn't be reused anymore (!). after i asked if it's possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away, they wanted to bill me for 200k. I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet. i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules. ####[['the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the owner and the staff generally polite , friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['i was offered free tea during check - in and check - out', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['good communication via whatsapp , the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff , they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel ( 30k ) saying it couldn ' t be reused anymore", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["i asked if it ' s possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away , they wanted to bill me for 200k", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

Helpful and always ready to help with everything. Good breakfast, functional rooms, super quick laundry service.

The room hasn’t been cleaned in three days and we had to ask for more toilet paper and new towels.

1137,The location in the Old Quarter was fantastic and close to everything. The street at the front of the hotel is closed at the weekend, so you may struggle to be dropped outside. This really isn't a problem! All staff were fantastic. There are so many trips and variations on offer and so it was difficult to know what was best for the budget. We listened to Mai's advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted. Everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back. For trips to Sapa, I would recommend the individual cabin on the bus as this was a godsend after such a long walk, try to get the cabin near the front as the ride is smoother and take mosquito spray. Travelling with children, Mai made this much more relaxed! We would recommend the Met restaurant close to the hotel. ####[['The location in the Old Quarter was fantastic and close to everything', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The street at the front of the hotel is closed at the weekend , so you may struggle to be dropped outside', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['All staff were fantastic', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["We listened to Mai ' s advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

Couldn’t fault it! ####[['We were upgraded to a suite on arrival , which was amazing and an epic way to start our trip to Halong Bay', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room was super luxurious and had the best shower we ’ ve had in Vietnam so far', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Beds were super comfy , and there was free Netflix too which was fab', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Wi Fi was super fast', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Staff couldn ’ t do enough to help', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]
138544,This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it's very near the Lake, the cute little streets, restaurants, night market, you name it. When you enter the hotel, you notice that the narrow entrance - which is normal for all hotels and houses in Hanoi - opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours, furniture and benches, and the most welcoming staff. Will, the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived, explained everything about the hotel and Hanoi as if he was a tour-guide, and he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits. Will is not the only gem in this hotel, as other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness, which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect. The hotel has a lift, a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby, the rooms have great beds (thank you) and a good lay-out for the space in an inner city hotel. It also has a lovely breakfast place (beautiful decoration) with good choices of food and drinks, and again great staff. However, one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the Skybar and roomservice is the best we had in Hanoi - by far. So we hope they create an inviting restaurant or rooftop eatery that creates a place for the chef to display her/his talents. Other good things to write about are the Spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff, and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place. Vietnam is colourful, and this is reflected in the interior design. We saw tourists stay here, as well as business people and locals, so we felt right at home. The hotel could possibly offer water refill-locations so less plastic is used, but it seems that Vietnam should tackle that problem in more hotels and locations. ####[["This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it ' s very near the Lake", 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours , furniture and benches', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['and the most welcoming staff .

899,Nice and New hotel. Friendly staff. Unfortunately, there was no breakfast Buffet as shown in the pictures, just a la carte (soup or sandwich or both, egg, watermelon, tea or coffee). Jacuzzi was a little dirty and cold. Outside of the hotel all other hotels are closed or not opened yet. It was pretty hard to find a restaurant or supermarket within 1-2 kilometers. ####[['Nice and New hotel', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Friendly staff', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['there was no breakfast Buffet as shown in the pictures , just a la carte', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Jacuzzi was a little dirty and cold', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Outside of the hotel all other hotels are closed or not opened yet', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['It was pretty hard to find a restaurant or supermarket within 1 - 2 kilometers', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

1646,Great location, very close to Hoan Kiem Lake and the rest of the old quarter. Lovely staff. Small rooms but comfortable. Despite the central location we couldn't hear the noise of the city from our room. The breakfast options were limited and the bread was not that fresh. Otherwise it was a pleasant stay. Breakfast options limited compared to other hotels. Pastries werent fresh.

138972,Overall, decent place to stay. Great location, lots of good restaurants nearby to get something to eat at any hour. No problems that would stop me from booking again. Good room. Lots of tiny drain flies, but they're harmless and it wasn't too bad. Pretend it's luxury camping. NO hot water whatsoever. You'll be taking showers in room temperature water. But I usually take scalding hot showers and am particular about cleanliness, and there were no dealbreakers. ####[['Great location , lots of good restaurants nearby to get something to eat at any hour', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['No problems that would stop me from booking again', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["NO hot water whatsoever .
