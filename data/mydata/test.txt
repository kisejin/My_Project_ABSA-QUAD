The hotel itself is also very charming - the rooms are very comfortable, the pool is beautiful, the garden is extremely well maintained. Overall you have the impression to be in a little piece of paradise. The food also was exquisite. Don't hesitate to wake up very early (5:45am) to enjoy a peaceful sunrise sitting on the terrace facing the river then grab a bike and go to the local market before going back for the breakfast!Also special note to the manager - he is doing an amazing job there and really appreciate his attention to detail.####[['We only spent one night here but wish we could have stayed longer', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['The location itself is beautiful near the river with epic sunset', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Extremely lovely hotel in the Mekong', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['the rooms are very comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the pool is beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' the garden is extremely well maintained', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The food also was exquisite', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["Don ' t hesitate to wake up very early ( 5 : 45am ) to enjoy a peaceful sunrise sitting on the terrace facing the river then grab a bike and go to the local market before going back for the breakfast", 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['special note to the manager - he is doing an amazing job there and really appreciate his attention to detail', 'Service', 'Positive']]

Also, you have to do the vegan cooking class and meditation with Lisa and Yong (one of our favorite memories), available on air bnb. One window in our room had no curtains so the room can get bright in the morning.

139112,We purposely chose Sapa Clayhouse as the finale of our Vietnam trip and it was such a treat for us. We booked the executive suite. Everything inside the room was perfect. We went in mid December their winter season, and we were pleasantly surprised that the bed was heated. The decor and furnishings of the entire place were tastefully done up too, so pretty that we requested to buy some vases as souvenirs. The staffs were all very professional and polite. Food was really good too, everything we ordered was a hit. And try their signature house cocktail mix it was so good! Highly highly highly recommend to make this place your last stop in Sapa. We were a little shocked that the housekeeping team actually went into our room to clean up while we were at the dining area having our meal. It was a nice and attentive gesture but would appreciate the option for us to choose if we want the service or not, as for our personal preference, we prefer not to have housekeeping service during our stay to prevent any mishaps. But overall the stay totally exceeded my expectations I highly recommend it.####[['We purposely chose Sapa Clayhouse as the finale of our Vietnam trip and it was such a treat for us', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Everything inside the room was perfect', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['we were pleasantly surprised that the bed was heated', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' The decor and furnishings of the entire place were tastefully done up too', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The staffs were all very professional and polite', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Food was really good too , everything we ordered was a hit', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Highly highly highly recommend to make this place your last stop in Sapa', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], [' We were a little shocked that the housekeeping team actually went into our room to clean up while we were at the dining area having our meal .

1163,- Tanya was a exceptional host, very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay. - Breakfast was super, a good selection of fresh items that are pre-ordered the evening before. The best pineapple juice we've ever had. Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast. - The room was huge, well thought out and as ascetically pleasing. - The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and "cute" at night - Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround. - The beach is a minutes walk away and surprisingly nice and clean. - Good number of affordable bars and restaurants (we went to Mr Hoà's Kitchen and The Tamarinde Tree, Baby Mustard) - Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies, local area. Or to cycle to Hoi An old town, busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly. - Can get a grab from the end of the road in to Hoi An old town for about 75k VND (10 minute journey), we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening. - The hotel is small and therefore the pool is, if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves - It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren't aware. - Bikes could do with some maintenance, oil, tyres, new bell etc - but this seems to be a theme in Vietnam :)####[['Tanya was a exceptional host , very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast was super , a good selection of fresh items that are pre - ordered the evening before', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["The best pineapple juice we ' ve ever had", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The room was huge , well thought out and as ascetically pleasing', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and " cute " at nigh', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' The beach is a minutes walk away', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['surprisingly nice and clean', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Good number of affordable bars and restaurants', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies , local area', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' to cycle to Hoi An old town , busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The hotel is small and therefore the pool is', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ["It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren ' t aware", 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['Bikes could do with some maintenance , oil , tyres , new bell', 'Service', 'Neutral']]

The resort needs to make and effort to bring it to the rest of the experience.

1010,I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential. With its prime location opposite the beach, attentive staff, and impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products, my overall experience was positive. While the hotel showed promise in many aspects, the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay. I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel's recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time. It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences. However, considering the hotel had only been operational for two weeks, this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy.####[['I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' its prime location opposite the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' attentive staff', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products , my overall experience was positive', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay', 'Service', 'Negative'], [" I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel ' s recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time", 'Service', 'Negative'], [' It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences', 'Service', 'Neutral'], [' this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy', 'Service', 'Neutral']]

1407,The boat itself is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay. It feels magical. The staff were extremely kind and welcoming. We did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized. Kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in Vietnam. All the food was quite good and was included. But, FYI if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise. The staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood. The baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window, so you can look out at the bay, which is great. This ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay. The balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures. No drinks are included and although they have a buy 2 get 1 free happy hour, the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying it would be nice if they were included. On the last day as well we went on the tour to the caves on the bamboo boats, which was great to see.

There are free bikes to use at the hotel which we loved and took them to Old Town and discovered the local area. The staff are on hand 24/7 to help out and even have a Whats App if you need their assistance whilst out etc. If you need anything the staff are happy to help. Ms. Kim was super helpful and gave us so many recommendations on local cuisine, activities and shows and also assisted in booking us tickets. We loved how the breakfast was freshly made and the staff kindly accommodated my allergies. There are several local options and amazing fresh fruit too. We will definitely be back and we recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Hoi An - you will receive the best hospitality experience!!

This hostel is very dominated by English backpackers and so it caters to a very party/drinking oriented crowd, so if this is not what you're looking for this is probably not the place for you. While the pool is a nice addition, it's rather small. The breakfast provided was really lacking variety though, and what they did have was not very nice.

139021,Ideal Homestay to get out of the crowds. The son speaks English, the parents do not, but they are sweethearts. Always willing to help and smiling. The beach is at 10 min walk and 3 in the motorcycle. If you rent one they'll let you park it inside the homestay. It's possible to wake up every morning and swim in the ocean (I did). You can order your breakfast (made to order), go to the beach, swim and when you come back, it's waiting for you in the room, where you can enjoy it in the spacious AC Room. I was able to leave my heavy luggage with them for 3 days, at no charge, I recommend tipping though, this is a true Homestay (they live next door), they are building it up based on our visits. Quiet and a breath of fresh air (ironically in a superhot & humid weather) compared to downtown Hoi An. 15min motorcycle ride through an amazing landscape (see photos). You can find better? probably (closer to the beach... i saw a couple of places, but it's hard to beat the value. Nothing####[['The son speaks English , the parents do not , but they are sweethearts .

So she could charge anything, disregarding the Booking's price. if you don't agree she would put you in a small stuffy smoking-smelling room, not as in the picture advertised. You are not allowed to remove the tray. 2. there is no cup/glass, or kettle available to discourage eating or drinking in the room. She had a set mind and tried to rule you as much as possible such as locking away all remote controls in the draw, and telling me that" no need to touch /change them". 3. When I complained about the TV not working and the water from the basin leaking on the bathroom floor, she was very argumentative, trying to put the blame on me. Instead of examining the problems or being willing to fix the issues. She was loud and aggressive and disregarded anything I said or requested persistently. She would never stop talking, once she was in my room. 4. The first day when I arrived I gave her my ID, she did not have any question. After she got to know me in he afternoon, she asked me if I have money to lend her, I laughed and left. When I got back that night I told her that I was very sick. She did not care but kept dragging on questioning my ID , trying to cause me trouble. I was very tired and sick and she would not leave me alone. When I told her that I was willing to pack my bag and leave immediately (eventhough it was almost midnight). She then shut up, and let me go to rest. The next day, the Bell boy asked me nicely if I would stay another day as booked, and tried fixing the leaking basin. So I stayed and She left me alone since. 5. Everyday, room was not cleaned nor rubbished being collected so brought them down to reception bin, she made me to throw them outside the building site. Lastly, I forgot to collect my ID after settling the account. upon realising, I called and asked her nicely to send it to my address in Saigon.####[['300 - 800m near buses , Co - Op mart , and 10 - 15 min walk to the main beaches', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['he owner / receptionist is particularly annoying', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["there is no price list .

138638,So much to say about this hotel. first of, the rooms were clean and functional, did not smell of humidity, had hot water, and the beds were really comfortable to sleep in. but the very reason you need to book this hotel is because of the staff! Tien is an amazing generous and selfless person. He arranged transport, offered to watch our luggages for a few days while we were out of town and most importantly, he was available and always here to help. I got sick with the flu during the trip and he was able to book me last minute another stay so I could rest. I can not recommend Hanoï Boutique House enough for your stay in the city.####[['the rooms were clean and functional , did not smell of humidity , had hot water , and the beds were really comfortable to sleep in', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the very reason you need to book this hotel is because of the staff', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Tien is an amazing generous and selfless person .
