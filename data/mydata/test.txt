544,Nice looking room, spacious with a bath. Our mistake not to check but about 1. 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started. This is a really noisy place, the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning (5. 30am) people using power tools. There are rodents in the roof. The bathroom looks great but the water doesn't flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over. The bath is really nice, but the hot water only fills about 1/5 of it at a time. Not that we would have used it, as it was too cold, but the pool was empty. Staff at reception were unwelcoming, didn't provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don't speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also, so made it hard to communicate at all. An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren't asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine, but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc. let alone wanted something else. We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves. When we realised this wasn't going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out. We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left. No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty because the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were 'unlaunderable' and had to pay 180,000 dong to replace them! So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins. So, this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam and don't recommend it at all. If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access. ####[['Nice looking room , spacious with a bath', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our mistake not to check but about 1 . 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['This is a really noisy place , the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['people using power tools', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['There are rodents in the roof', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The bathroom looks grea', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["the water doesn ' t flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The bath is really nice', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the hot water only fills about 1 / 5 of it at a time', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Not that we would have used it , as it was too cold , but the pool was empty', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["Staff at reception were unwelcoming , didn ' t provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don ' t speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also , so made it hard to communicate at all", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren ' t asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine , but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc . let alone wanted something else", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["When we realised this wasn ' t going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were ' unlaunderable ' and had to pay 180 , 000 dong to replace them", 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["don ' t recommend it at all", 'Loyalty', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

Also the close proximity to the airport and free shuttle service for our departure was excellent. The pool area had no staff in attendance through out the day and I had to go down to the lobby to ask for towels to be sent up. Also there was no option to order meals/drinks at lunch time at the pool; as the staff did not start until 4pm. Again I went down to the restaurant in the lobby to ask about getting a meal & drinks sent up to the pool. I was told the only way we could do this was to order room service and take it up to the pool. So we had to return to our room, order our meal then return to the pool. In that time our towels had been removed so had to go get more towels. All this inconvenience could have been fix with either one staff member in attendance at the pool during the day or a telephone at the pool bar with instructions to call & order meals/drinks over the phone.

139222,From the moment I set foot in the door the staff were amazing from start to finish. Tommy (Manh) looked after me like I was part of his family. I ended up getting scammed by a cab driver as it was my first trip to Hanoi and I didn't know any better. 1 call to Tommy and he came straight over to sort it out! He calls you cabs, rents you bikes, changes money cheaply and get you sim cards. Its a hotel but also a one stop for all your needs becuase they really care about you having the best time possible. I cannot speak highly enough of my experience there with them. I had a balcony room, it was very clean, serviced each day I was there and everything worked as I should have. If you are looking to rent a place in the heart of old quarter, which is within walking distance of a lot of things to do, then this is definitely the place to go! Oh and make sure you get the breakfast. It was fantastic 12/10 That I had to leave!

138879,It really was a great hideaway and base for exploring Ben Tre. It is located on the quieter side of the river and way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel. The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area. The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more. The homestay itself is cute and homely, with a small shared living space that you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions. The rooms are located just behind a little stream at the back and provides total quietness. Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them! We stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view. Internet is great and we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us. It was such a lovely place to get away from HCMC for a few days. It is a great value for price!

A suggestion for improvement would be to have a second card to access the room. if travelling in a group, this may be of inconvenience if you decide to return to the hotel at different times.

Finally, we booked a free walking tour with Yam and Dong through Tripadviser. It would be great if the hotel can create a partnership with them for guests who would like a guided tour (English speaking) to explore Hanoi. Yam and Dong were so kind and truly amazing tour guides.

I kindly ask Sandy at reception if there is any place where I could change 20-30USD. She said (and that was not true) that it is Sunday so everything is closed. She offered me really bad exchange rate (quite worse then the one I got at Intecontinental a day before) and once more confirmed I can not exchange it outside. After that (lie) i went out and after 1min walk saw that there are many touristic small agencies where you can exchange money with quite better rate. I was really dissappinted because it a small cheating which simply makes all worse than it might be. So don't cheat that way - it is not ok. I came back and said that at reception. I did not get even "I am sorry." Breakfast was also modest but ok.

The room was spacious and well appointed and mostly comfortable. Liked the deep soaking tub in the bathroom, though didn't use it. A broad selection of toiletries was provided (except for body lotion). Instant coffee, electric tea kettle, and a mini bar with an assortment of beer, soft drinks, and water. Very nice hotel! Hotel is new and did not seem ready for guests. There were several minor items that needed attention: Batteries in the safe door were needed, for example. Room phone was not set up for operation, there was no room service menu. These were minor but annoying. In addition, check out took way too long (20 minutes).

It started off with little bit of a snatch theft incident and a police report - their staff stayed with us through all 5 hours and translated everything with the police (thanks Shuang!!). The owners of the hotel, a sweet pair of aunty and uncle, tried to make up for it by packing a small picnic for our Mua Cave visit.

We were especially concerned about the fact that the staff doesn't speak any English (basic level), they are not friendly (not even to the local guides), no room service is provided, the breakfast is very minimal.

818,It is quite a modern hostel with all facilities. In fact it looks like a good hotel. There is plenty of space in the dorms, and in the restaurant area near reception. The beds are large and comfortable. In fact the beds are like a capsule, so once you close the curtain, there is full privacy. The bathrooms are sufficient and well equipped. They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop. I rented motorbike from here. They have really new and good quality bikes. The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house. They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat, cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike. The extra luggage can also be stored for free. They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop. The staff at the reception speaks and understands English. While the facilities are top notch, their maintenance is not upto the mark. People wear shoes in the dorms, there is nobody responsible for the lockers. There are lockers but the key is not available. I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people. They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests. The dorms are air conditioned, but since the beds are capsule type, there is no ventilation inside the cubicle.

Phoung and his lovely wife took so well care of me, they treat their guests literally like family. I initially wanted to stay only one night as a stop over coming from Sapa, heading to Hanoi. However I liked it so much instantly, that I decided to stay 2 nights. The freshly cooked breakfast and dinner, eaten together with the family, was the best meals I have had in Vietnam. Phoung brought me on a boat trip on Thac Ba Lake, which was amazing. In the evening he brought me and one other guest from India to play volleyball and dance together with his wife and her friends in the village.

771,We had a great and extremely comfortable stay at this hotel. First of all the hotel is just at a 10 mins walkable distance from old town, lantern lake, japanese bridge etc which makes it a perfect location. In terms of cleanliness, room size and amenities as well I'd rate the hotel excellent. The hotel staff is extremely courteous and friendly. A special mention to the receptionist 'Nga'' she is very humble and ensures the guests have a very good experience. She understands and speaks English which makes it easier to communicate and ask for any information as a tourist, she goes out of her way to help you out. The hotel has a small restaurant and staff attending to your food needs and making the environment very homely. Their services are excellent, we had a small glitch with the hot water in our room, when we raised the concern, it was immediately resolved. Overall we had a very good experience and would strongly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a pleasant stay at hoi an Nothing ####[['We had a great and extremely comfortable stay at this hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['First of all the hotel is just at a 10 mins walkable distance from old town , lantern lake , japanese bridge', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['s it a perfect location', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["In terms of cleanliness , room size and amenities as well I ' d rate the hotel excellent", 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hotel staff is extremely courteous and friendly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['she is very humble and ensures the guests have a very good experience', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['She understands and speaks English which makes it easier to communicate and ask for any information as a tourist , she goes out of her way to help you out', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hotel has a small restaurant', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['staff attending to your food needs and making the environment very homely', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Their services are excellent', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we raised the concern , it was immediately resolved', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we had a small glitch with the hot water in our room', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Overall we had a very good experience', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['would strongly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a pleasant stay at hoi an', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

1999,A wonderful and peaceful oasis in the busy area of Cai Be. As we know the only place right on the river. We had a river view bungalow and it was really fantastic to watch all the life floating on the water. Staff and restaurant are not very professional due to lack of English language. But they are working hard and try to improve constantly. The pool and spa area are nice and the rooms are well equipped. Can't imagine to find a better place in the area. The private boat tour we booked was not worth it. There is no more floating market in Cai Be. So if you want to see dirty houses and trash go for ot. Better option is to ride the bike to town or on the island. ####[['A wonderful and peaceful oasis in the busy area of Cai Be', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We had a river view bungalow and it was really fantastic to watch all the life floating on the water', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Staff and restaurant are not very professional', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['lack of English language', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['But they are working hard and try to improve constantly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The pool and spa area are nice and the rooms are well equipped', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["Can ' t imagine to find a better place in the area", 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The private boat tour we booked was not worth it', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['There is no more floating market in Cai Be', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['So if you want to see dirty houses and trash go for ot', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Better option is to ride the bike to town or on the island', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]
