138400,First impressions - amazing use of space and a great meet and greet. Breakfast - excellent, very fresh and different each day Laundry service - free and done for you, which is just great! Location - whilst not the most central location, the host got us taxi's as we couldn't use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim! We also used Google maps and the local bus, which is very cheap and reliable! So I didn't find location as issue at all. My husband loved the free gym! Whilst we did love our stay I feel it necessary to talk about what we didn't like. This place doesn't know what it wants yo be! It's guests are mainly young English teachers who actually live there medium to long term, so it's their home! We felt a bit like we were staying in their house. They are young, and with that came lots of night time noise, and socialising with friends not guests of the homestay right under our window until 2am on a couple of occasions. I expect young people to be noisy, it's normal, but I felt at the cost to other guests. This is because the place is mixed with different types of guests, and doesn't really have a true identity. This mixed with a very hard uncomfortable bed equaled a major lack of sleep for me! However, we did still enjoy our booking, but I feel this feedback is necessary for mid age guests, where noise might be an issue. ####[['amazing use of space and a great meet and greet', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast - excellent , very fresh and different each day', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Laundry service - free and done for you , which is just great', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Location - whilst not the most central location', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ["the host got us taxi ' s as we couldn ' t use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['My husband loved the free gym', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['we did love our stay', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['we did still enjoy our booking', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

Staff are very friendly and go the extra mile to help us (helping us sort out flight issues / walking through attractions in the area), which is so essential especially if you don't speak vietnamese. Having stayed in a couple of hotels in Hanoi, I would come back here everytime ####[['This hotel has fantastic decor - a modern oriental feel while being new and clean', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["Also love the location , it ' s near to but not in the heart of old quarter so you still get some taste of non - touristy Hanoi while being situated near to plenty of great food spots and a convenient cheap family mart down the street", 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Staff are very friendly and go the extra mile to help us', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['I would come back here everytime', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ["which is so essential especially if you don ' t speak vietnamese", 'Experience', 'Positive']]

139199,Exceptional location! Surrounded by mountains and with a lake in front, away from the chaos of city, serene and peaceful. The property is nestled within a well maintained garden, has swings and a lounging/dining area. the room was spacious, clean with decently done decor, a large bathroom and deck. I loved the view from the room- of the sun coming up from behind the mountain and shining on the lake, filling the room with sunlight. Hai - the host is quite a barista and brews very good Italian coffee. The family dog Gung - is very friendly and welcoming. The hosts were very welcoming and generous - even offering to help with our laundry. I would without a doubt recommend this place to stay. Note: The location is ~ 2 kms from city centre and dining options. So you will need a motorbike/cycle to get there. The property will be able to help with those options.

1498,The hostel's staff is one of the nicest and kindest I've met during my travesl. They always take interest in you and are very patient and helpful, and give the hostel a homey feeling. The rooms are spacious, nice and cosy, good smell, and the beds are super comfortable. I really liked the storage arrangment. I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that! The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom. First, it was located on the bottom floor seperated from all the rooms in the hostel. The way there is exposed with no ceiling. On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom. I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way. The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well. As it is raining quite often in Sapa I think that's a problem... also there's only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel. Another thing to mind is the location - it's about 10-15 min. climb up the hill from town. It's not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather. ####[["The hostel ' s staff is one of the nicest and kindest I ' ve met during my travesl", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They always take interest in you and are very patient and helpful , and give the hostel a homey feeling', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The rooms are spacious , nice and cosy , good smell , and the beds are super comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I really liked the storage arrangment', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['The way there is exposed with no ceiling', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["there ' s only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["Another thing to mind is the location - it ' s about 10 - 15 min", 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['climb up the hill from town', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ["It ' s not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather", 'Experience', 'Negative']]

1516,This is a cozy family home that has everything you need. Don't expect anything too fancy though. As a solo travel who usually stays at hostels, it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel. The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening. The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I've stayed at. Bathroom was shared but was always empty. The private room also locks. Everything I could ask for! Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market. The stairs inside the home are a little challenging. The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small (I had to navigate them going down with my feet sideways). Fortunately, my room was on the first level above ground, but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you. Also, finding the apartment was a little tricky. Finding the address of the building was fine. Take the concrete stairs up a flight and go down the first hall to your right. There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it's easy to miss. I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end, but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn't confirm if I was at the right place. I left but ended up being redirected back to the apartment. The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English. The whole family is lovely, but it can be hard to find the apartment. ####[['This is a cozy family home that has everything you need', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I ' ve stayed at", 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Bathroom was shared but was always empty', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The private room also locks', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Everything I could ask for', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The stairs inside the home are a little challenging', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['finding the apartment was a little tricky', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['my room was on the first level above ground , but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['The whole family is lovely', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['it can be hard to find the apartment', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end , but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn ' t confirm if I was at the right place", 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it ' s easy to miss", 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

The next day, whilst we were out on a tour, my booking was marked as a no show. We spoke to staff that evening and they said it was a mistake so I booked again for the following night. This time it was cancelled again during the night. They clearly didn’t want me to write a bad review and do this whenever there are complaints.

The hotel is a nice modern hotel with 3 towers of rooms connected by a bridge. Nice view of Lan Ha bay from each room. It is a short walk into town, or you can arrange for an electric car to take you.- for 10,000 vnd ea.

139608,The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport. The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance. Owner stays just next door so it’s easy to reach out if you have any issues provided that she’s at home. Room is comfy and clean. Aircon is a little weak but it works. Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair. Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin. Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin. Owner gave the pin to the metal gate via message through Booking. com’s app but just note that the metal gate is right in front of the apartment on the 5th floor, not the big gate on ground floor facing the street. Since the apartment is located on the 2nd street away from the main road, it’s not too noisy at night. The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries. There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe. The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift. Luckily there is a cement strip laid over the staircase which probably is meant for bicycles but it works fine to roll my small suitcase up. You’re also supposed to pay your room fee upon arrival in cash - which the fault is mine since I didn’t read carefully before booking. So be prepared to bring extra cash, or exchange money in the many shops at the night market. ####[['The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ['Aircon is a little weak but it works', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Room is comfy and clean', 'Facility', 'Positive']]

139480,I would give this place 0 stars if it were possible. The false advertisement about free bicycles, which lead us to book this place instead of one closer to town/ the pier, was not regarded as the hotels fault. The staff, who couldn't speak English, was not willing to find a solution both parties were happy with and denied calling the manager. We offered many different solutions but all were denied by the homestay's staff and manager who was responding via Whats App. As a guest this felt very rude and the opposite of welcoming.

1455,The place is exactly as expected from the pictures and reviews. The owner helped us upgrade one twin room to a family room, and it was very spacious. She also helped arrange bikes and motorbikes for us to borrow to travel to the city center and helped troubleshoot problems when needed. Overall, we were very impressed with the hospitality. We arrived by car from Da Nang and had some trouble navigating since the alley to this place was very narrow, but there was some parking space in front of the villa itself so it wasn't a problem. You will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away (free bikes, motorbikes, car - bit difficult considering the alley, or taxis and other options).Some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim - to fit the vibe. I wouldn't recommend this place for those with small children because the pool facilities and general structure of the place are not very child-friendly. ####[['The place is exactly as expected from the pictures and reviews', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['The owner helped us upgrade one twin room to a family room', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['it was very spacious', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['She also helped arrange bikes and motorbikes for us to borrow to travel to the city center and helped troubleshoot problems when needed', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Overall , we were very impressed with the hospitality', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['there was some parking space in front of the villa itself', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['You will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ['Some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["I wouldn ' t recommend this place for those with small children", 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['the pool facilities and general structure of the place are not very child - friendly', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

1439,The property is converted from an old government office building to homestay. Its design is based on the concept of local ethnic groups in Sapa. You could see the owner put a lot of efforts on the design and materials used. Many recycled and traditional local ethnic group materials are used in the homestay. The staff were super helpful and friendly during my stay. They recommended some cafes with awesome view and try their best to fulfill my request. This homestay serve vegan food for lunch and dinner. I tried their local Vietnamese style began food and it was delicious. The chef has many years of working experience in hospitality line. She worked in 5-stars resorts in South East Asia and Middle East. As it was low season due to covid-19, the owner took extra mile by offering me a personal trip from Sapa to Y Ty when i asked him for tour package. It was a wonderful experience although the journey was not easy for me. In short, the price/night is considered under value (properly due to low season and covid-19) in view of the level of services provided by them.

The hotel is a 10-min walk from the city center and there are only 6 rooms, which makes it quieter at night. We could also use the shared kitchen to cook our baby meals. Only Nhi and his girlfriend speak good English, so it can be difficult to get understood with the others. I think it’s part of the experience and enjoy that, but be warned.

We often spent over one hour to having breakfast in the restaurant. The quality of the room is excellent, Although my room was not very large, it is very clear and provided with drinks, coffee and tea bags and fruits. During the Lunar new year holiday, Hotel celebrated the new year with the Red packet and biscuits! Also, we could book the transportation to the airport, all payment can be settled in the front-desk. The price is fair. The staff could confirm everything with us the date before our departure.

1294,We stayed at Golden Holiday for a few days, in a total of 3 rooms. I'm going to give you lots of details about our stay, so you can see if it is right for you. Short story - we really enjoyed it!First the rooms - rooms are quite large, with very nice sheets, towels, pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers. We're not talking super high-end, but for the price the rooms are great. Some rooms have a small sofa - ask if your room has one, or request one. Wi-fi worked great> Toilets worked well, with nice bidets attached. If you want a large, comfortable room - I don't think you can go wrong here. Staff - staff are great. This place is well staffed, there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk, always willing to go out of their way for you. Especially Thuy and Ms. Kim - they are fantastic and will help make your stay very enjoyable. They often called "electric shuttles" for us, which worked well for transporting 5 people from 1 - 3km away. Breakfast - there is a large breakfast buffet available every day from 7 to 10AM. Ours was included in the room rates. There was great coffee, also fruits, salads, asian, and some western items. Some days there were bacon and chocolate crossaints. You could always get eggs cooked anyway you liked. No pancakes or waffles, but I don't think these are very common in Vietnam. It was easy to grab some pastries to go from the breakfast buffet so you had some snacks for later on. Pool - there was a medium sized pool outside. It was nice, clean - not super huge but large enough to do laps in it. Location - it is located right on a semi-busy street, but we never heard noise from our rooms, as it is set back a bit from the road. There are plenty of spas and restaurants in the area - but you are outside of the super busy, noisy "old town" tourist area. It is a quick 5 min electric shuttle ride ($2 usd) or a 22 minute walk to the main "old town" walking areas. ####[['we really enjoyed it', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['rooms are quite large , with very nice sheets , towels , pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["We ' re not talking super high - end , but for the price the rooms are great", 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Some rooms have a small sofa', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Wi - fi worked great', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Toilets worked well , with nice bidets attached', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['staff are great', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['This place is well staffed , there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk , always willing to go out of their way for you .

793,This is a phenomenal place to stay in Hanoi. It is close to the lake and all the action in the old town while providing a luxurious retreat from Hanoi's craziness. The breakfast was wonderful with so many choices in the lovely room overlooking the lake and old town Hanoi. We enjoyed the rooftop bar on two nights and loved watching the city fade to dark at sunset. The rooms are on the small side but have everything you need. The beds are cozy and AC works very well. Anthony, Leo, and Simon were particularly helpful at the front desk with anything we needed. Staff goes above and beyond to care for you. This was the perfect place to start and end our month long journey in Vietnam. This was my second stay and I did not like the bathtub/shower combo unit in my room this time.

138483,For our wedding anniversary celebration, my family decided to stay at this lovely resort called Memorina. And wow, did it surpass our expectations! Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery, it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape. The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat, bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region. We spent hours wandering around the resort, discovering charming nooks, admiring the vibrant plant life, and even giving fishing a shot. One of the highlights was visiting the sheepfold – an experience that not only captivated us but also filled our kids with wide-eyed wonder. Watching their faces light up as they interacted with the sheep was absolutely heartwarming. During our stay, we were treated to a gentle evening rain, which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand. All in all, our time at Memorina etched a truly special memory in our family's journey. ####[['We spent hours wandering around the resort , discovering charming nooks , admiring the vibrant plant life , and even giving fishing a shot', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive , always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['it surpass our expectations', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['During our stay , we were treated to a gentle evening rain , which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ["our time at Memorina etched a truly special memory in our family ' s journey", 'Experience', 'Positive']]

When I questioned this at the hotel they said as I did not want to do the mud bath part I chose not to go on the trip I asked for, however that was always optional.

139250,The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture. There were ample electrical socketss. The bathroom and plumbing was quite good. The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy. There was plenty of parking near the gate. There was easy access to a lovely clean beach, direct from the resort. There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures. it was surrounded by trees giving ample shade to the loungers. The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view. There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure, Napoli being the best. We have used this one many times in the past. There are some small local shops ( kiosks) for basic needs. The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer. Not much! Like a lot of the resorts here, they suffer from a lack of customers during covid so have an air of being a bit run-down. However the faults were minor and did not detract from our stay. The restaurant only had a partial service due to lack of customers. There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning, when the resort filled up for the weekend. At other times there was a limited menu. There wasn't anywhere to hang wet clothes after, say, a swim and nothing to sit on outside. ####[['The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There were ample electrical socketss', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The bathroom and plumbing was quite good', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There was plenty of parking near the gate', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There was easy access to a lovely clean beach , direct from the resort', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure , Napoli being the best', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There are some small local shops ( kiosks ) for basic needs', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning , when the resort filled up for the weekend', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['At other times there was a limited menu', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["There wasn ' t anywhere to hang wet clothes after , say , a swim and nothing to sit on outside", 'Facility', 'Negative']]
1181,The location was perfect, you could walk everything by foot in district one. The bed was super comfy, the room spacious and with a lot of sunlight. Very clean also The staff could speak english better, sometimes it was hard to communicate, when i needed sth. i know im the foreigner, so i should make an effort to learn the local language, but when you stay only a few days its hard. ####[['The location was perfect , you could walk everything by foot in district one', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The bed was super comfy , the room spacious and with a lot of sunlight', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Very clean', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The staff could speak english better ,', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['sometimes it was hard to communicate , when i needed sth', 'Experience', 'Negative']]
138370,Clean and comfortable. The host is very nice, friendly, and helpful. We arrived very late and we didn’t have dinner. The host still prepared dinner for us even though we didn’t pre-order. Room rate with breakfast included was really cheap.
