1294,We stayed at Golden Holiday for a few days, in a total of 3 rooms. I'm going to give you lots of details about our stay, so you can see if it is right for you. Short story - we really enjoyed it!First the rooms - rooms are quite large, with very nice sheets, towels, pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers. We're not talking super high-end, but for the price the rooms are great. Some rooms have a small sofa - ask if your room has one, or request one. Wi-fi worked great> Toilets worked well, with nice bidets attached. If you want a large, comfortable room - I don't think you can go wrong here. Staff - staff are great. This place is well staffed, there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk, always willing to go out of their way for you. Especially Thuy and Ms. Kim - they are fantastic and will help make your stay very enjoyable. They often called "electric shuttles" for us, which worked well for transporting 5 people from 1 - 3km away. Breakfast - there is a large breakfast buffet available every day from 7 to 10AM. Ours was included in the room rates. There was great coffee, also fruits, salads, asian, and some western items. Some days there were bacon and chocolate crossaints. You could always get eggs cooked anyway you liked. No pancakes or waffles, but I don't think these are very common in Vietnam. It was easy to grab some pastries to go from the breakfast buffet so you had some snacks for later on. Pool - there was a medium sized pool outside. It was nice, clean - not super huge but large enough to do laps in it. Location - it is located right on a semi-busy street, but we never heard noise from our rooms, as it is set back a bit from the road. There are plenty of spas and restaurants in the area - but you are outside of the super busy, noisy "old town" tourist area. It is a quick 5 min electric shuttle ride ($2 usd) or a 22 minute walk to the main "old town" walking areas. ####[['we really enjoyed it', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' rooms are quite large , with very nice sheets , towels , pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["We ' re not talking super high - end , but for the price the rooms are great", 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Some rooms have a small sofa', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' Wi - fi worked great', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Toilets worked well , with nice bidets attached', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['staff are great', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['This place is well staffed , there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk , always willing to go out of their way for you .

946,Everything. A suggestion for improvement would be to have a second card to access the room. if travelling in a group, this may be of inconvenience if you decide to return to the hotel at different times. Another suggestion for improvement (unless I missed it) would be to have a leaflet by the hotel to keep with useful local information. Finally, we booked a free walking tour with Yam and Dong through Tripadviser. It would be great if the hotel can create a partnership with them for guests who would like a guided tour (English speaking) to explore Hanoi. Yam and Dong were so kind and truly amazing tour guides.

139855,Good location around 5 minutes from the beach. The rooftop pool had a good view across the city. The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con, comfy bed, fridge, toiletries. The hotel was very noisy. We had a large family who used the hallway and lift as a playground, with the children screaming and crying while the parents shouted up and down the hallway from 5. 30am until midnight each day. We told reception who didn't care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy. There are alarms on the hotel bedroom doors as they are awkward to close, the alarms are good for safety however the other rooms would leave their doors open with the alarms beeping from early until late which again kept us awake. The hotel is not 4*, more 2 or 3*, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating. The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily. The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up. We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym, just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment, no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill. There are lots of hotels in the area - I wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price. ####[['Good location around 5 minutes from the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The rooftop pool had a good view across the city .', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con , comfy bed , fridge , toiletries', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The hotel was very noisy', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["We told reception who didn ' t care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy", 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The hotel is not 4 *, more 2 or 3 *, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym , just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment , no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['I wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price', 'Branding', 'Negative']]

609,rien My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare. From the outset, the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous. The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic English. In a highly unprofessional move, he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking. com platform, promising “better apartments, better views, and more check-in options.” He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times! And after reading reviews from previous guests, I discovered that those who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn’t get any of the promised benefits. The deceit didn’t stop there. On the check-in day, the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower. This was a complete bait and switch, and it left us feeling utterly duped. To add insult to injury, the apartment itself was a disaster. The furniture was old, worn, and filthy, and the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online. It was smaller, older, and lacked any charm or modern decoration. The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding. As if that weren’t enough, the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay. We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water. It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard.

But when we woke up, we opened our curtains to find the most amazing view of the surrounding landscape. It was absolutely stunning! I’d stay at this hotel again just for the view. Our room was also very beautiful and clean. We loved the balcony where we could take in the views. The hotel is incredibly beautiful and the grounds are well maintained. There are flowers and plants everywhere which just add an extra layer to the place. The staff were also very helpful in arranging taxis into Sapa and Cat Cat Village. Since the bungalows are quite close together, there were a few guests who were incredibly loud which disturbed our sleep. The hotel manager apologised for this incident the next morning which was appreciated. Breakfast could be improved. We mainly ate eggs, but the offering could be a bit more diverse. ####[['The view from our room was amazing', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['we opened our curtains to find the most amazing view of the surrounding landscape .

1163,- Tanya was a exceptional host, very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay. - Breakfast was super, a good selection of fresh items that are pre-ordered the evening before. The best pineapple juice we've ever had. Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast. - The room was huge, well thought out and as ascetically pleasing. - The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and "cute" at night - Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround. - The beach is a minutes walk away and surprisingly nice and clean. - Good number of affordable bars and restaurants (we went to Mr Hoà's Kitchen and The Tamarinde Tree, Baby Mustard) - Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies, local area. Or to cycle to Hoi An old town, busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly. - Can get a grab from the end of the road in to Hoi An old town for about 75k VND (10 minute journey), we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening. - The hotel is small and therefore the pool is, if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves - It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren't aware. - Bikes could do with some maintenance, oil, tyres, new bell etc - but this seems to be a theme in Vietnam :) ####[['Tanya was a exceptional host , very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast was super , a good selection of fresh items that are pre - ordered the evening before', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["The best pineapple juice we ' ve ever had", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The room was huge , well thought out and as ascetically pleasing', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and " cute " at nigh', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' The beach is a minutes walk away', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['surprisingly nice and clean', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Good number of affordable bars and restaurants', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies , local area', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' to cycle to Hoi An old town , busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The hotel is small and therefore the pool is', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ["It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren ' t aware", 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['Bikes could do with some maintenance , oil , tyres , new bell', 'Service', 'Neutral']]

1042,We did an extensive review (in person as well) of all the hotels in the area and I would say this one is the best one. The design of the hotel is super nice, with a very warm and crafty feeling! The views are absolutely gorgeous. The rooms are big and comfortable. I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics. The room was clean, bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white. The maintenance of the hotel is not the best, which is a real pity, because it was designed so nicely. When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage. The hot water is very inconsistent when showering, sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself! Some staff is nice, others not so much. I think the language barrier is the biggest problem because almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude, which I don't think it's their intention. I would suggest the management trains the people a bit better. ####[['The design of the hotel is super nice , with a very warm and crafty feeling', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' The views are absolutely gorgeous', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The rooms are big and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The room was clean , bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The maintenance of the hotel is not the best , which is a real pity , because it was designed so nicely', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage .', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The hot water is very inconsistent when showering , sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' Some staff is nice', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude', 'Service', 'Negative'], [' I think the language barrier is the biggest problem', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['I would suggest the management trains the people a bit better', 'Service', 'Neutral'], [' all the hotels in the area and I would say this one is the best one', 'Branding', 'Positive']]

They got in touch with us quickly and then couriered it to us at our next hotel. They did this promptly and kept us posted throughout. They even helped organise a bike for us while we were there. The decor of the room and the hotel in general was very nice! They have used natural materials in a very pleasing and balanced way. The tea set that they provided in the room was exceptional – it came with loose leaf tea, a kettle with a built-in sieve and two beautiful ceramic cups. We had a lovely view of the emerging skyline in the vibrant city of Da Nang. The room had a balcony and natural light coming in from 2 directions. The location is convenient. It's in the heart of the city – just 10-15 minutes from any other part of the city including the airport! ####[['The staff was really professional and went beyond their way to help us out', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['We had forgotten our medicine pouch in the room after checking out .

139010,The food and service staff were all excellent. I found the booking process very irritating, I received several Whats App calls and texts in the days before the cruise from the sales consultant Hang Nga telling me she had a big problem because she had double booked my room, she wanted me to spend one night in a cheaper room then move to my original booked room for the second night. I found her texts to be increasingly bizarre and late at night. She then told me she had a sick child and needed my help. She then offered to buy me a drink in Hanoi if I would just accept her plan to use the cheaper room. She was concerned about her job and realised she had made a big mistake. I was paying a lot of money for this cruise and did not want to move rooms. I told her it was her problem and she would have to fix it. I was traveling with friends and wanted to treat myself to a nice room on this cruise. Her constant texts caused me al lot of unnecessary stress in the days before getting on the cruise. The 2nd day outing wasn't very interesting. The tour guide for the day was annoying and kept asking for a tip. ####[['The food and service staff were all excellent', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['I found the booking process very irritating', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The tour guide for the day was annoying and kept asking for a tip', 'Service', 'Negative']]

There is a bit of noise from the street and neighbouring rooms which happened to be noisy in my case,, but the traffic noise comes with staying in the Old Quarter I suppose.

793,This is a phenomenal place to stay in Hanoi. It is close to the lake and all the action in the old town while providing a luxurious retreat from Hanoi's craziness. The breakfast was wonderful with so many choices in the lovely room overlooking the lake and old town Hanoi. We enjoyed the rooftop bar on two nights and loved watching the city fade to dark at sunset. The rooms are on the small side but have everything you need. The beds are cozy and AC works very well. Anthony, Leo, and Simon were particularly helpful at the front desk with anything we needed. Staff goes above and beyond to care for you. This was the perfect place to start and end our month long journey in Vietnam. This was my second stay and I did not like the bathtub/shower combo unit in my room this time. It leaked all over the floor and was very annoying. In my first room, I had a walk-in shower that did not have this issue.

She also helped arrange bikes and motorbikes for us to borrow to travel to the city center and helped troubleshoot problems when needed. Overall, we were very impressed with the hospitality. We arrived by car from Da Nang and had some trouble navigating since the alley to this place was very narrow, but there was some parking space in front of the villa itself so it wasn't a problem. You will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away (free bikes, motorbikes, car - bit difficult considering the alley, or taxis and other options).Some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim - to fit the vibe.
