The location despite being great is right at the end of the night market which means on a Friday night it is incredibly noisy. The hotel is also split into two so we went to the wrong hotel first - but they are only about 20 metres apart so not a big issues though we also had to go to the other hotel for breakfast, We were on the 7th floor and had to take an incredibly slow lift to the 6th floor and then stairs to the 7th - worth considering if you have mobility issues.

421,Incredibly comfortable bed. Great location. Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements. Preface: Their claim is "Beyond Perfection" and it is marketed as a "Luxury Boutique" 5 star hotel. While beautifully designed, many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience (function of light switches, relative position of shower and towel for maximum water coverage of said towels, maintenance work during check-out hours) and some elements already are showing wear and tear. For a 5 star hotel, the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training, with very odd formalities that were unnecessary, poorly executed, or just awkward. We also received a phone call to our room at 4:48am, which was a mistake by reception. When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves. (The manager did reimbursed us for transport when it was brought to her attention) The cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed. Known classics were watered down and almost unrecognisable in their taste. ####[['Incredibly comfortable bed', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Great location', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['beautifully designed', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['some elements already are showing wear and tear', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['For a 5 star hotel , the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training , with very odd formalities that were unnecessary , poorly executed , or just awkward', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['We also received a phone call to our room at 4 : 48am , which was a mistake by reception', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Known classics were watered down and almost unrecognisable in their taste', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed', 'Service', 'Negative']]

Although it is close to Bui Vien street (also known as a walking party street), the guesthouse is located in a little alley, where the music from the bars can't be heard. The highlight of my stay was Ms Vy, she is an excellent host! Ms Vy accompanied me to the local banh mi festival that was happening during my stay. She was great, explaining the local dishes and helping me order food. With her I got to try many delicious Vietnamese food. After that we went on a walk and did a little bit of sightseeing. She also gave a little map with everything explained, including some words in Vietnamese in case you need to ask directions to locals! She's a lovely person and I enjoyed a lot spending time with her. I truly recommend staying at Vy Khanh Guesthouse! What a lovely day I spent in Ho Chi Minh!

Phoung and his lovely wife took so well care of me, they treat their guests literally like family. I initially wanted to stay only one night as a stop over coming from Sapa, heading to Hanoi. However I liked it so much instantly, that I decided to stay 2 nights. The freshly cooked breakfast and dinner, eaten together with the family, was the best meals I have had in Vietnam. Phoung brought me on a boat trip on Thac Ba Lake, which was amazing. In the evening he brought me and one other guest from India to play volleyball and dance together with his wife and her friends in the village.

138745,Facilities are very good. The swimming pool is on the rooftop and an infinity pool and it’s stunning especially when the Sun is shining you can just spend the day there topping up your tan and drinking cocktails. In The evening they have a band playing in the sky bar which is nice and jolly. The food choice at the rooftop pool and bar area is very disappointing and it’s expensive. However I would recommend the steakhouse. The service is pretty slow at reception I waited seven hours for them to fix my phone in my room. Had to call off my mobile phone several times to remind them and the air con wasn’t working and as no one turned up I ended up having to go down stairs in my pjs to ask for someone to come up.

1494,Wonderful time here! While trekking through the jungle, Mr. Co taught me how to use my sense to navigate and search in there. Sometimes, after silently chasing a gibbon family by following their sound, we stayed at the same spot for 15 minutes just to watch their activity. That time we feel like we are a part of the jungle. Homestay's facilities are good. You are also served by two other receptionists (a dog and her child). They will welcome you in the morning when you open your room and notify you when the food is ready. Just be careful with your food in front of the cat, because he is the king ^^. ####[['Wonderful time here', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['While trekking through the jungle , Mr .

519,I really liked my stay at Lam Vien Homestay as it was quaint and really comfortable. I adored getting the chance to speak with owner and learn a little more about his and Hue's history. Plus, I arrived so early and they were more accomidating me as I rented a bike and joined one of the other travellers to journey together. My room was ideal, it was on the first floor and had easy access to the bathroom and privacy if wanted. Breakfast and other things were available though I didn't partake as IO have my own dietary means and wanted to see the city which is so full of history and excitement. I finally arrived late in the evening after consuming as much of the wonder that is Hue. I came back to what was supreme quiet and excellent accommodation as I prepared myself some food and go the comfort and quiet of a evening left to my own devices. Being close to both the north and south sides of Hue, I went off to explore as I would leave reasonably early the next morning and was delighted to be so well placed. I really recommend this incredible homestay and encourage you to stay as long as you can because there is so much that makes Hue ideal to travel and experience.

139164,The room was fine. Nothing overwhelming. Small bathroom incl. a shower (not seperated) underneath the starecase. So definitely nothing for tall people. The homestay is very close to the beach and has a very nice design as advertised in the pictures although a little worn down in the room itself. In my case I didn't have a window - only one to the hall way. The owner is not living at the same place so I had to wait to get instructions about the key code etc. However, that also made it very easy to check-in and out. Overall, good value for your money and would stay another time, maybe in a bigger room (that was sold out at that time) There were quite a lot of (old) spider webs in my rooms. Couldn't harm to get rid of them.

975,The bed was solid and comfortable. Rubber flip flop and hairdryer provided. Great location 1min from the beach, 1min from a great variety of restaurants and shops, 20min walking to city centre. The tiled floor in the room looked spotless but under the bed there was all sort of rubbish (incl. a dead cockroach) that would fly around when the window was open. There is just one socket just on one side of the bed. The a/c pointed right at the bed head making very uncomfortable to sleep. The balcony was just 300mm deep, not made to sit outside nor hang your towel after being at the beach. The handrail was totally rusty. The view from every window of the building opens on the rubbish thrown in the perimeter land. The toliet sit is 5fingers smaller than the toilet itself. Shower water runs weak but it works incl. hot water. Very poor breakfast incl. coffee, tea, bread, ham and some fruit. Some staff members din't speak english and they din't make any effort to understand me. Once they knew I was up in the morning, the cleaning staff invaded my room ignoring if I still wanted to stay in the room. It happened to me at 8am. They made the bed pulling the top sheet but leaving the bottom one all messy from your night of sleep. Excluding the entrance hall which looked clean and tidy, the overall condition of the building is dirty and sloppy, uncl. stained carpets and stained table cloths. ####[['The bed was solid and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Rubber flip flop and hairdryer provided', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Great location 1min from the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['1min from a great variety of restaurants and shops , 20min walking to city centre', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The tiled floor in the room looked spotless', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['under the bed there was all sort of rubbish', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['that would fly around when the window was open', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['There is just one socket just on one side of the bed', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The a / c pointed right at the bed head making very uncomfortable to sleep', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The balcony was just 300mm deep , not made to sit outside nor hang your towel after being at the beach .', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The handrail was totally rusty', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The view from every window of the building opens on the rubbish thrown in the perimeter land', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['The toliet sit is 5fingers smaller than the toilet itself', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Shower water runs weak but it works', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['hot water', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Very poor breakfast incl . coffee , tea , bread , ham and some fruit', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["Some staff members din ' t speak english and they din ' t make any effort to understand me", 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the cleaning staff invaded my room ignoring if I still wanted to stay in the room', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['It happened to me at 8am', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['They made the bed pulling the top sheet but leaving the bottom one all messy from your night of sleep', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the overall condition of the building is dirty and sloppy , uncl . stained carpets and stained table cloths', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the entrance hall which looked clean and tidy', 'Facility', 'Positive']]

524,We ended up staying at the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, so I can only comment on that. Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom. We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool. Breakfast was very good and a sensible price. if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel. Very handy little shop called Moon Milk on the street corner. A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage. The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing. We landed on a (relatively) cold and rainy evening and took the long taxi ride from Da Nang airport. The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance. We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that. There was a notice on the door saying to go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, giving the address. A sketch map would have been useful! It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel. The gentleman on reception took us up to a room, leading in and coming back out very rapidly. Obviously there was some kind of problem, and he wished to be professional about it. He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card. We were ushered to another room, which was clearly an upgrade. Whilst it lacked a couple of things (such as a toilet roll, which appeared the next day), it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom. To the credit of the manager, he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances. ####[['Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast was very good and a sensible price', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['A sketch map would have been useful', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The gentleman on reception took us up to a room , leading in and coming back out very rapidly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Obviously there was some kind of problem , and he wished to be professional about it', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['We were ushered to another room , which was clearly an upgrade', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Whilst it lacked a couple of thing', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['To the credit of the manager , he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances', 'Service', 'Negative']]

Nhung is adorable and made our stay perfect. She was always there to help with anything, be it renting a motorcycle, giving general tips, booking tickets for us or doing our laundry. The breakfast is great, you can chose one dish out of a list of ~30 dishes. We tried many of them and they were all tasty! It also includes fruits, coffee and a different juice everyday. The location is perfect if you want beach and not stay in the busy and very touristy old city town. The hotel has bikes available that you can use whenever you want to go into town (15-20 min ride ) or you can rent a motorcycle if you have the license. Driving in Hoi An is much easier than the busier Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh.

19,The location was great, a big yet quiet street, close to the city centre and other good local restaurants. We stayed in an 8-bed dormitory room, yet there was still enough space left to place our luggages and sit around. The bunk bed was far large enough for 1 person to roll around, power outlet and curtain were equiped for each single bed, which was a big plus. The host was super hospitable and helpful. You can always ask her for the guidance to anywhere around Cao Bang. She even accepted our late check out request when our car only arrived at 2pm. If you need more slippers or change the towels, they could always support. It would be better if there is more dust bin inside the room. There was only 1 in the bathroom when we stayed. There were still some dust/ cloth dust on our beds/ bedsheets when we arrived.

139460,Our experience at Zizi homestay in Sapa was a spiritual journey that allowed us to witness the sacred rituals and beliefs of the Hmong community. The lodge, surrounded by towering peaks, provided a breathtaking setting for our trek. The guided trek led us through sacred sites, ancient temples, and shared moments of spiritual reflection. Each step felt like a step towards embracing the sacred wisdom of Hmong culture. The reverent hosts guided us through traditional ceremonies, offering us insight into their spiritual practices. Back at the lodge, we were treated to a sacred ritual, witnessing the deep reverence the Hmong have for their ancestors and nature. As the sun set, we gathered for a contemplative meditation session, enveloped in the profound tranquility of the mountains. While our overall experience was fantastic, some guests noticed occasional water supply disruptions, which added to the rustic charm but might cause minor inconveniences.

274,We stayed in one of the pool villas and it was amazing! It was like a spacious 1 bedroom apartment. The perfect way to end our 4 week stay in Vietnam. The buffet breakfast which was included in the price was without doubt the best we had, so much on offer. The pool was great. And the restaurant Blu Lobster is amazing, we ate there twice. Make sure you watch the sunrise as well, stunning. One small complaint, they were unable to give us a complimentary 2pm checkout, so we booked the hotel shuttle to take us to the airport at 1 for a 3. 45 flight. The man then told us we dont need that much time to be at the airport. And tried pushing us back to 2. We compromised for 1. 45. But had to sit in the lobby bored out of our minds, at least at the airport there are things to look at and we could have got lunch. And I like to mot be rushed at the airport Always go with what you want.

139572,Bamboo Farmstay is where I enjoyed the most authentic Vietnamese hospitality experience of my entire trip. The owner, Nam, his sister, and the entire family were extremely kind, attentive, and caring throughout our stay. Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh, but I insisted on paying for it, as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me. Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex, a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future. I highly recommend visiting this area now, before the crowds descend. Nam's farmstay is a hidden gem, and I'm glad I chose it over other homestays that were located in a cramped area with a challenging road. This farmstay, on the other hand, is situated on a good road, close to the main thoroughfare that leads to two of Ninh Binh's main attractions: the pagoda and the river tour. The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent, and the Vietnamese cuisine they serve is simply delicious. Although they normally close at 9 PM, they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry. While the rooms are quite basic, they offer air conditioning and hot showers, and for the price, they are an unbeatable deal - under $10 per night! You'll also have the chance to stay in a charming bamboo bungalow, which is a real treat. All in all, I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future. I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience. ####[['The owner , Nam , his sister , and the entire family were extremely kind , attentive , and caring throughout our stay', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh , but I insisted on paying for it , as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex , a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['I highly recommend visiting this area now', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Although they normally close at 9 PM , they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['While the rooms are quite basic , they offer air conditioning and hot showers , and for the price , they are an unbeatable deal - under $ 10 per night', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience', 'Loyalty', 'Positive']]

1445,Sam was very helpful and great to talk to and personable. it was lovely to hear how this is a family run business and his elderly mum rises early to buy bread/things needed for the retreat from the market. Great location for boat rides of the caves and visiting some amazing stores in the area. Beds were very comfortable, and bikes and motor cycles helped in getting around more efficiently. The pool looked lovely but it was too cold to swim. Sam was also great in organising onwards taxi transfers. Bit too ‘rustic’ with long grass throughout the area, and very old/dated furniture. No ice cream, yogurt or rice available as per menu until next day. Dirt road into the property, which had many potholes.

The food from the restaurant was lovely, and we had all our meals there. The wine list is also excellent! By far the most exceptional part of the experience was the staff, who went above and beyond to make our stay special. They even surprised me with a birthday cake and sang happy birthday to me at dinner! And they also decorated our room with rose petals and a hand-written card. So special! The only (small) issue we had was in trying to use the wooden bath. It’s BEAUTIFUL but extremely difficult to fill unless you want a pretty cold bath. The hot water runs out too quickly to fill it.

Mrs Phuong woke up to let us in when we arrived at 1am and gave us a lovely room. They had an elevator as well which was heaven for us after being up 5 flights of stairs in Hanoi! The room was clean, spacious and had a balcony, TV and refrigerator. The hotel is right opposite the train station so easy to get to. We rented bikes from them for only 100K a day, Mrs Phuong gave me a quick lesson as I hadn’t rode for years. Overall a lovely stay and would recommend to anyone.

As the building is very narrow (most buildings in this area are narrow), the bathroom sink is placed within the bedroom, rather than the bathroom, making it slightly inconvenient. ####[['located in the centre of Hanoi', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The Hanoi Paradise Centre Hotel & Spa was a quaint hotel', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['walking distance from any of the lovely attractions that the city has to offer', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The Hotel has a very nice staff who were welcoming and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['we loved the breakfast', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["The hotel located in a very narrow lane and is easy to miss if you don ' t have a driver / guide", 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['the bathroom sink is placed within the bedroom , rather than the bathroom , making it slightly inconvenient', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

1638,Hang and Khu are exceptional hosts. We felt like welcomed family. We enjoyed their fine cooking skills at the family dinners every night. Each dinner is a minimum of 8 dishes made from local fresh ingredients. The breakfasts are delicious. This is a beautiful new guesthouse with indoor plumbing and heated beds. The decorating is very warm and inviting. The outdoor area is large with many places to relax and enjoy the scenery. The location is convenient to nice day spas and coffee shops. We stayed 4 days and highly recommend this guesthouse! ####[['Hang and Khu are exceptional hosts', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['We felt like welcomed family', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['We enjoyed their fine cooking skills at the family dinners every night', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Each dinner is a minimum of 8 dishes made from local fresh ingredients', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The breakfasts are delicious', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['This is a beautiful new guesthouse with indoor plumbing and heated beds .', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The decorating is very warm and inviting', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The outdoor area is large with many places to relax and enjoy the scenery', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The location is convenient to nice day spas and coffee shops', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['We stayed 4 days and highly recommend this guesthouse', 'Loyalty', 'Positive']]

579,All the staff were lovely. In particular Thuy and Ahn. We were made to feel like family and they went out of their way to make our stay more enjoyable. The hotel owner was also lovely, she even gifted us on departure, which is a beautiful and very appreciated gesture .The team of staff are very small and we’re mostly all lovely. The rooms were beautiful and way above the standard of what we paid. Breakfast was good there were both western and plenty of Vietnamese options, but the fruit selection in the morning was always fresh and plentiful. The staff always ask if you want anything special cooked for breakfast and went out of their way to order us yummy pho for breakfast (they don’t usually have this on the menu. The pool is actually bigger than what we expected and was made great use of during the hot Hoi An summer heat . Overall excellent value for money There wasn’t a lot to fault about this hotel. If I have to be picky, it was probably further away from market then we imagined. But it was extremely hot when we were there,and we aren’t game enough for motorcycles, so it may have felt further away then it was . Vihn (I think that’s his name , the only male front concierge) can work on his customer service skills. He could see we were checking out and lots of suitcases, given we had to walk down three flights of stairs, he could have at least offered to assist. He’s probably the worst concierge I’ve dealt with in my time in Vietnam . But he wasn’t enough to ruin my stay.

Cafe downstairs makes great coffee and is open pretty late.

Bathroom walls could have used a good wipe down, and we noticed some ants in the kitchen area after cooking one night, but they were gone once the room was serviced and the garbage had been removed.

139010,The food and service staff were all excellent. I found the booking process very irritating, I received several Whats App calls and texts in the days before the cruise from the sales consultant Hang Nga telling me she had a big problem because she had double booked my room, she wanted me to spend one night in a cheaper room then move to my original booked room for the second night. I found her texts to be increasingly bizarre and late at night. She then told me she had a sick child and needed my help. She then offered to buy me a drink in Hanoi if I would just accept her plan to use the cheaper room. She was concerned about her job and realised she had made a big mistake. I was paying a lot of money for this cruise and did not want to move rooms. I told her it was her problem and she would have to fix it.

138323,absolutely gorgeous, even better in real life - felt like a boutique-y four seasons. the bar on the top floor was beautiful and all of the food at the restaurant fantastic. whoever designed or built the hotel is clearly a world traveler with impeccable taste. gym was really nice too (did not take advantage of the spa) service was great except at the pool - constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the (quite large) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don’t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down. It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting, you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes. Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment, you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot (or didn’t understand because of language barrier?). Then by then the food is cold. Frequently saw 2-3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention. Also, the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours (this was a Monday afternoon) stirring up lots of insects. Why isn’t this done early morning or evening when there are less people trying to enjoy the pool? If it weren’t for the pool experience being unpleasant, I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation. Because of this, I don’t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn’t enjoyable to sit by the pool. But we still would come back for the rooms, gym and food. ####[['absolutely gorgeous , even better in real life', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['all of the food at the restaurant fantastic', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['the bar on the top floor was beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['felt like a boutique - y four seasons', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['gym was really nice too', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['service was great except at the pool', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the ( quite large ) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don ’ t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting , you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment , you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Then by then the food is cold', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Frequently saw 2 - 3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['stirring up lots of insects', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['I don ’ t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn ’ t enjoyable to sit by the pool', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['But we still would come back for the rooms , gym and food', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['If it weren ’ t for the pool experience being unpleasant , I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation', 'Branding', 'Neutral']]

1102,New hotel, ok location Quite simply, the hotel lied...about many things. Lie 1) I booked this hotel for my wife's birthday as it has a spa centre, as per the info on their website. There is NO operating spa centre. When I asked about this I was told it was still under construction and that if I wanted to book a spa we can walk around the corner. Lie 2) I'm training for a triathlon so when I saw that the fitness centre is open 24 hours, I thought great! The gym closes at 7pm and is NOT 24 hours. Also, the treadmills don't work. The belt stalls with each step so you can't even walk let alone run. And there are no sanitizing wipes, towels, bins or even access to water. Lie 3) The sunset bar looked great on their website, especially with the snacks and "signature cocktails" noted. There are NO cocktails and no snacks. And what the heck is the point of a pool and bar that closes at 7pm? I kept being told, not enough staff. Lie 4) The restaurant '12 Kitchen' is listed on their website as serving a buffet breakfast and dinner. There is NO dinner served and the breakfast closes at 9:30am. Lie 5) The hotel is listed on booking. com as 5 stars?! I'm not sure on which planet they got this rating but it is a 3 star at best. Definitely not an international standard 5 star. There is also, NO room service and nothing in the mini bar in the rooms. The rooms are ok, but...Upon arrival, the top shelves in the wardrobes were very dusty and we had to wipe them down before using them. The rooms were relatively clean but definitely not to a high standard. Housekeeping staff didn't even wash the glasses on a number of occasions. There is only a kettle with a couple of sachets of coffee issued. The toilets....oh the toilets...if you plan on using anything more than 3 individual squares of toilet paper, be prepared for a blocked toilet.

I thoroughly recommend this hotel and can't believe it isn't at least 4 stars. It is a little away from the main area but if you don't mind riding a scooter and really getting lost in the city and realising how much that has to offer or catching a grab taxi it is really worth while. If you stay right in the main area you don't get the full experience of Hanoi. ####[['Very modern and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['great spa bath if you wish', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['nice big TV with Netflix', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['there is no breakfast', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['it is a great area with loads of fantastic cheap eaterys close by , cheap as Banh mi which is a great breakfast staple', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Nice lake at the end of the street with great coffee shops on the opposite side', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Great to support the local venues and get away from the touristy hot spots', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['I thoroughly recommend this hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ["can ' t believe it isn ' t at least 4 stars", 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['It is a little away from the main area', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ["but if you don ' t mind riding a scooter and really getting lost in the city and realising how much that has to offer or catching a grab taxi it is really worth while", 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ["If you stay right in the main area you don ' t get the full experience of Hanoi", 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

1042,We did an extensive review (in person as well) of all the hotels in the area and I would say this one is the best one. The design of the hotel is super nice, with a very warm and crafty feeling! The views are absolutely gorgeous. The rooms are big and comfortable. I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics. The room was clean, bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white. The maintenance of the hotel is not the best, which is a real pity, because it was designed so nicely. When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage. The hot water is very inconsistent when showering, sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself! Some staff is nice, others not so much. I think the language barrier is the biggest problem because almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude, which I don't think it's their intention. I would suggest the management trains the people a bit better. ####[['The design of the hotel is super nice , with a very warm and crafty feeling', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The views are absolutely gorgeous', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The rooms are big and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The room was clean , bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The maintenance of the hotel is not the best , which is a real pity , because it was designed so nicely', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage .', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The hot water is very inconsistent when showering , sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Some staff is nice', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['I think the language barrier is the biggest problem', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['I would suggest the management trains the people a bit better', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['all the hotels in the area and I would say this one is the best one', 'Branding', 'Positive']]

1580,The room was comfortable and clean, and the pool was very nice (apart from the rubbish at the bottom). It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi’s are available to get into town. The cleaning staff were very friendly. The staff weren’t helpful - there is a clear lack of management. The pool bar wait times are ridiculous, 1. 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water, 1. 5 for food as well. On our first 2 days the wait wasn’t as bad but there was only one person, the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long. The food and drink is also very overpriced (western prices) and very average. The laundry service is ridiculously expensive, we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear! There is no local advice available from the staff. We weren’t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren’t offered the welcome drink they advertise. Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment. The breakfast is constantly running out, and even if all the food and drink is available, there are no cups or plates to use! The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover, there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it. Overall, this is a 3 star experience, but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it’s a good option. ####[['The room was comfortable and clean , and the pool was very nice', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi ’ s are available to get into town', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The cleaning staff were very friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The staff weren ’ t helpful - there is a clear lack of management', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The pool bar wait times are ridiculous', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['1 . 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water , 1 . 5 for food as well', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['On our first 2 days the wait wasn ’ t as bad but there was only one person , the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The laundry service is ridiculously expensive , we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The food and drink is also very overpriced', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['and very average', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['There is no local advice available from the staff', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['We weren ’ t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren ’ t offered the welcome drink they advertise', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The breakfast is constantly running out , and even if all the food and drink is available , there are no cups or plates to use', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover , there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['this is a 3 star experience , but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it ’ s a good option', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

958,We had 2 rooms with street view. The rooms were a bit musty but once the aircon kicked in it wasn't too bad. Beds are hard and water flows out from shower to toilet room. There is a lift to ground floor but you then need to go down another 2 set of stairs to get to the pool. Not good for people in wheelchairs or with mobility issues. I ended up having to go outside and walk down driveway to get to pool. Repeatedly asked to get mini fridge replaced in one room but they had no idea. Kept saying yes and everyday it still didn't work. Gave up after 3 days. The breakfast was quite good. Had a variety of food for buffet and even on the day they did a la carte there was a good choice. Only a 10 min walk to night market. The pool looked nice and the kids enjoyed it. They do supply a towel for swimming. They need more people that can understand English at the front desk. Not sure I would use it again but it was fairly cheap. The ground floor was in construction and nothing down there, just empty rooms. Reception was on 1st floor. Lift should have really gone down to pool level. ####[['We had 2 rooms with street view', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The rooms were a bit musty', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["once the aircon kicked in it wasn ' t too bad", 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Beds are hard and water flows out from shower to toilet room', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['There is a lift to ground floor but you then need to go down another 2 set of stairs to get to the pool', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Not good for people in wheelchairs or with mobility issues', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['Repeatedly asked to get mini fridge replaced in one room but they had no idea', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["Kept saying yes and everyday it still didn ' t work", 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The breakfast was quite good', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Gave up after 3 days', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['Had a variety of food for buffet and even on the day they did a la carte there was a good choice', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Only a 10 min walk to night market', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The pool looked nice and the kids enjoyed it', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['They do supply a towel for swimming', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['They need more people that can understand English at the front desk', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['Not sure I would use it again', 'Loyalty', 'Neutral'], ['it was fairly cheap', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The ground floor was in construction and nothing down there , just empty rooms', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Reception was on 1st floor', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Lift should have really gone down to pool level', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['I ended up having to go outside and walk down driveway to get to pool', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

140206,Halong Bay is a must when you travel to Vietnam, and there are many options out there. We did a lot of research on the number of days to stay on the boat and also, which company to use. We opted for Le Theatre cruise 2 days 1 Night (2D1N), because of the itinerary and the activities. The boat itself is very luxurious and you feel like a star when the crew welcomes you on board. The cruise was not busy and so we had the chance to be upgraded to their best suite, for free! Views were absolutely incredible from that room. The food in the evening is also good, attention to the details was appreciated. Highly recommend this company, as it is one of our highlights of our trip. Make sure to book the luxury limousine transport from Hanoi to the boat, it's worth it!!!

Surelee, the owner has to change a little bit her attitude. I understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude. Her property, which she named a "homestay", doesn't quite reflect what a homestay should be, since, being Italians and having Italian dishes on the menu, we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused. Also, in my opinion she push to much the customers to purchase her trekking tour which are very expensive compared to the ones found walking by the villages. Finally, the 2 shared bathrooms were not only toilets but also showers, and in the morning they were both constantly busy with people taking showers for hours; it would be good to have a separate toilet in order to avoid the queue ####[['Beautiful woody accommodation in the middle of the nature , with a stunning view of the paddy rice from the second floor balcony', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The Thai food was also very good and cheap', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Surelee , the owner has to change a little bit her attitude', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['I understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Italians and having Italian dishes on the menu , we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['in my opinion she push to much the customers to purchase her trekking tour which are very expensive compared to the ones found walking by the villages', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the 2 shared bathrooms were not only toilets but also showers , and in the morning they were both constantly busy with people taking showers for hours ; it would be good to have a separate toilet in order to avoid the queue', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

Ha in particular, the hostess, is a diamond woman who is so helpful and kind. The hosts were so kind and accommodating - emailing me at 7pm to check my check in time and allowing me a late check in. I don’t recommend you do this (and it’s difficult to do) but I fell in a rice paddy and they cleaned me, my clothes and made me a late dinner. It is one of the best stays I’ve ever had.

In particular, the soup of rice noodles is very delicious, so I recommend you to try it. The location of the accommodation is near Miding, but it's a little far away. Please note that it's not a distance that you can't walk at all, but it'll be a burden to walk in the middle of the heat. Fortunately, you can visit various attractions in Hanoi using the grap service. The room condition is very very excellent. A comfortable bed and living room(has a comfortable sofa) are provided, and simple cooking is possible with a simple kitchen. I was able to travel comfortably because they cleaned and managed it every day. Also, there was a washing machine on the balcony, and it was so nice to be able to wash wet clothes with sweat. The product description says that there are four bathrooms in three rooms, but in reality, there are three bathrooms in three rooms. The toilet tissue location is so far away that you have to twist your body into an acrobatic way to touch the tissue. There is no space to put shampoo or soap in the shower booth. There's not enough space to put soap in the sink. In addition, it does not provide soap. Items provided include shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush, and toothpaste. ####[['The breakfast served at the pantry on the 5th floor every morning was good because I could have a light breakfast', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['the soup of rice noodles is very delicious', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["The location of the accommodation is near Miding , but it ' s a little far away", 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ["Please note that it ' s not a distance that you can ' t walk at all , but it ' ll be a burden to walk in the middle of the heat", 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['you can visit various attractions in Hanoi using the grap service', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The room condition is very very excellent', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['A comfortable bed and living room', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['are provided , and simple cooking is possible with a simple kitchen', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['they cleaned and managed it every day', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['there was a washing machine on the balcony , and it was so nice to be able to wash wet clothes with sweat', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The product description says that there are four bathrooms in three rooms , but in reality , there are three bathrooms in three rooms', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The toilet tissue location is so far away that you have to twist your body into an acrobatic way to touch the tissue', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['There is no space to put shampoo or soap in the shower booth', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["There ' s not enough space to put soap in the sink", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['it does not provide soap', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Items provided include shampoo , conditioner , toothbrush , and toothpaste', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I was able to travel comfortably', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

140102,Staff were friendly, helpful, polite. We ended up booking Hà Long Bay tour, Sapa trekking tour, and Nimh Binh with them for the convenience and price. Good advice would be to not book too early and check the weather...better to go sooner while the weather is tame than to be pushed for time and have to cancel some things. Luckily for us, we had time. The location is great and we used this hotel as a base as we did 1-3 day trips around Hanoi. They were great with communication and super accommodating. Highly recommend as a good accomodation for the cost. Hotel construction started at 7:30-11am and we weren't warnded/informed. They were very apologetic about it and we are totally understanding as they have to do it at some point. It would just be considerate to let guests know beforehand (and I have given this same feedback on their checkout form).Still, the room is nice and I would come back to stay here!

1467,This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach. The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach, but since the beach wasn't very busy, you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across. The resort itself is extensive but it doesn't feel too large; it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends, so these times are busy. The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps. There are plenty of beds around that pool and you can have drinks there. The restaurant is good, so spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option. The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration. On the whole, the design of the place is amazing, with plenty of Koi carp ponds, wooden carving, well-maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms. The staffs were amazing and it's really nice to talk to them (thank you Ann!). What has been the best for us was the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil, a nice pool, the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well (Covid had closed that down). It's worth it staying there for a week or more if you're looking for a relaxing pool/beach holiday, but for food you have to either use their restaurant, or use a few local restaurants nearby - or go into town, of course (which you have to as Hoi An is an amazing, but touristy, town!) It's not so much what we didn't like, but maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well. Also, the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient, but the last one back from town is at 17. 30, so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back, which is a bit of a hassle when it gets busy. ####[['This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['the design of the place is amazing , with plenty of Koi carp ponds , wooden carving , well - maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["The staffs were amazing and it ' s really nice to talk to them", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil , a nice pool , the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["It ' s worth it staying there for a week or more if you ' re looking for a relaxing pool / beach holiday", 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient , but the last one back from town is at 17 . 30 , so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The resort itself is extensive', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There are plenty of beds around that pool', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The restaurant is good', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['you can have drinks there', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["the beach wasn ' t very busy , you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across", 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends , so these times are busy', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

They advertise 24 hour reception so I thought nothing of checking out early in the morning to catch my 6 AM bus to the airport. There was nobody in reception except a security guard who, upon my spouse and I loading our bags onto the bus, proceeded to make a scene (yelling at myself and the driver) that I had yet to pay. I went inside to pay and found out he (security guard) could not administer payment. He had trouble getting ahold of the man in charge of reception. Meanwhile my bus driver was beginning to unload our things and was attempting to kick us off the bus as we were now behind schedule. I pleaded to him, explaining that the hotel had my credit info and I could be billed, and made the same plea to the security guard. To no avail. I was now refusing to get off the bus because I had a flight to catch, and caught between two men screaming at eachother and at me. I'm not sure I've faced that level of anxiety before in my life. All due to a false promise of 24 hour reception. Anyway, don't rely on the 24 hour reception, and don't expect to be treated with common decency by the staff (this doesn't apply to the guy working reception, he was actually kind and respectful). ####[['Comfortable bed .

I have been in many hôtels and I must say it's first time I see bugs infection in a bed. Unfortunately also the breakfast was full of ants which made it hard to enjoy breakfast. At the swimming pool, it's crowded, no-one showers including the football team who swims all dressed directly after the match at the neighbor stadium... This hotel deadly requires a management with some knowledge on hygiene because right now it's awful and unacceptable at a 4 stars... ####[['The reception has always been very helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They helped me rent a motorbike and also helped me change the room when I discovered the bugs in the bed', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Hygiene is unfortunately terrible', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["I have been in many hôtels and I must say it ' s first time I see bugs infection in a bed", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the breakfast was full of ants which made it hard to enjoy breakfast', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["At the swimming pool , it ' s crowded , no - one showers including the football team who swims all dressed directly after the match at the neighbor stadium", 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["This hotel deadly requires a management with some knowledge on hygiene because right now it ' s awful and unacceptable at a 4 stars", 'Service', 'Negative']]

139484,Wow, Wow, Wow! This property and the family that own it are just exceptional, our only regret is that we were only booked to stay for 2 nights, we really wish we could have stayed longer! The hospitality that we received here was exceptional, they go above and beyond. The breakfast is plentiful and delicious, they have free bikes for use at any time, they offer free foot baths which we used and they brought to our rooms. Upon returning from a day out on their bikes we received a knock on our room door, and they had brought cold juices for us! I commented on their homemade pineapple jam, and received a jar of it to take away with me, and on our departure day the gave us water and snacks to take with us on our long journey.

We also loved the indoor koi fish pond which was full of giant koi fishes swimming around. Staff service is excellent and helpful. Location is good as it’s not located by the main road which can be noisy but it’s just right behind the main road and is walking distance to the beach. The breakfast is pretty decent and has everything for a wholesome breakfast. The wooden blinds in the bathroom was difficult to operate. The toiletries provided - shower cream, shampoo & conditioner could be better. The rattan interior also needs some fixing as the cabinet doors with rattan was damaged when we checked in. ####[['We like the design aesthetic of the hotel which gives a very authentic local vibes', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The garden view studio has a nice pair of lounge chairs with a small coffee table facing the outside garden', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['We also loved the indoor koi fish pond which was full of giant koi fishes swimming around', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Staff service is excellent and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Location is good as it ’ s not located by the main road which can be noisy but it ’ s just right behind the main road and is walking distance to the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The breakfast is pretty decent and has everything for a wholesome breakfast', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The wooden blinds in the bathroom was difficult to operate', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The toiletries provided - shower cream , shampoo & conditioner could be better', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['The rattan interior also needs some fixing as the cabinet doors with rattan was damaged when we checked in', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

The rest of the bathroom was well equipped and clean. The bed was comfortable and extra wide. The entire apartment was very clean and offered sweeping views across downtown Haiphong.

183,The staff were friendly and helpful. The location is good, the beach is 5 minutes on foot away and there's plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. It's quite cheap. The mattress in the room was horrible. There was a huge dent in the center. At the time the hotel was being renovated, so maybe they would have changed it out, but I think they didn't. The room I stayed in had no window, so it was quite stuffy, but that was expected for the price. I peeped into a renovated higher end room on that floor (the door was open because of the construction), and it looked pretty good. The fridge didn't work (no cooling effect whatsoever) and the little bottles of shower gel and shampoo in the shower seemed to all be missing the little straws inside so you cannot really use the pump on it, which was weird?!The landromat was expensive: 120. 000vnd (or more) for a load of clothes. I literally paid a quarter of that for the same load in Hanoi's Old quarter. Also, I got changed into another room on my last day there, and that was annoying. ####[['The staff were friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["The location is good , the beach is 5 minutes on foot away and there ' s plenty of cafes , bars and restaurants nearby", 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ["It ' s quite cheap", 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The mattress in the room was horrible', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The room I stayed in had no window , so it was quite stuffy', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['that was expected for the price', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ["The fridge didn ' t work", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the little bottles of shower gel and shampoo in the shower seemed to all be missing the little straws inside so you cannot really use the pump on it', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The landromat was expensive', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['I got changed into another room on my last day there , and that was annoying', 'Service', 'Negative']]

487,Breakfast was excellent. They served both Asian and western breakfast, so you have plenty of choices to choose from. Ms Camellia recommended us a sightseeing tour to Trang An which was a wonderful trip. They also have a Spa in house. My husband and son were happy with their ‘Vietnam Authentic Massage’! In the evening we enjoyed ourselves at the poolside with beers or cocktails.

1029,Our stay at Azerai was great. The staff were friendly and super attentive, and the facilities were nice and new. From the moment we were picked up, we were very well taken care of. One minor issue of an old razor being found in our room was made up for with a room upgrade. Food in the restaurant was good, albeit a little pricey but options in Can Tho were easy to access. The staff were great in recommending various places to visit. The highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local’s house while we waited for the rain to pass. Everything was super genuine and authentic - The guide, also a resort employee, grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing! Lastly the hotel transfer from Ho Chi Minh City was excellent - a comfortable limousine van which made the two hour trip each way enjoyable. Would recommend to visit, and stay in the Lake rooms. We started in the Garden Room, but the view from the Lake Room is better. If possible try avoid the weekends and local school holidays as the resort is much quieter. It was overall GREAT value for money, however the experiences/tours and the restaurant were a bit on the pricier side. ####[['Our stay at Azerai was great', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The staff were friendly and super attentive ,', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['the facilities were nice and new', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['From the moment we were picked up , we were very well taken care of', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Food in the restaurant was good , albeit a little pricey but options in Can Tho were easy to access', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The staff were great in recommending various places to visit', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local ’ s house while we waited for the rain to pas', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Everything was super genuine and authentic', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The guide , also a resort employee , grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['made the two hour trip each way enjoyable', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Would recommend to visit , and stay in the Lake rooms', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['We started in the Garden Room , but the view from the Lake Room is better', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['If possible try avoid the weekends and local school holidays as the resort is much quieter', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['It was overall GREAT value for money', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['however the experiences / tours and the restaurant were a bit on the pricier side', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['Lastly the hotel transfer from Ho Chi Minh City was excellent - a comfortable limousine van', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['One minor issue of an old razor being found in our room was made up for with a room upgrade', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

138789,Staff was great and super helpful. Breakfast was good, it was nice that you can order different dishes every morning from the menu on top of the buffet. Location was ok, not that close to old quarter but ok walking distance away. Room was cleaned well, we had a complimentary fruit basket in the room. Surfaces in the room were somewhat worn out, and there was some visible water damage in the bathroom, tiles were cracked etc. You could hear all the noises from the hallway. The walls/windows were so thin, that it felt like the windows were open because the traffic noises were so loud, and it was a little hard to sleep. Update // They asked us to do a written review about the hotel upon check out. We wrote same things on that and here in the booking review. Mostly great things about the service and staff, only complaints was the noises and the fact that the room might need some updates/renovations. We waited in the hotel lobby for a car to pick us up to the airport, and the manager came to us apologizing and they gave us a 50% refund from the car service. We thought that was unnessecary, but it felt nice that they reacted to our feedback. I also wrote this booking review waiting in the lobby, usually I wait to get out of the hotel to do that, I should’ve done it now too. The manager had seen my booking review and came back to talk to us, asking us to change the review from 8 to 10. We felt super uncomfortable that he asked us to do so. We just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. For that point we had nothing but great things to say about the staff, but now it left us with a bad taste to our mouths, and this wasn’t a great ending to our 2-week trip to Vietnam, which had been nothing but lovely so far.

139222,From the moment I set foot in the door the staff were amazing from start to finish. Tommy (Manh) looked after me like I was part of his family. I ended up getting scammed by a cab driver as it was my first trip to Hanoi and I didn't know any better. 1 call to Tommy and he came straight over to sort it out! He calls you cabs, rents you bikes, changes money cheaply and get you sim cards. Its a hotel but also a one stop for all your needs becuase they really care about you having the best time possible. I cannot speak highly enough of my experience there with them. I had a balcony room, it was very clean, serviced each day I was there and everything worked as I should have. If you are looking to rent a place in the heart of old quarter, which is within walking distance of a lot of things to do, then this is definitely the place to go!

139280,We like the location of this hotel. It is very close to the center but not noisy. The staffs are friendly and helpful and they arrange activities like basket boat tour and cooking lessons. If you are staying in this hotel, I highly recommend booking the combined basket boat tour and cooking lessons with Mr Cu. It was fun for us. We were upgraded to the top floor but the room was not clean e. g. candy wrappers from previous guest, mirror is not clean and the bathroom has molds. We asked to be transfered to another room and they did. The next room was okay but I woke up in the middle of the night smelling molds again. I hope they will make some updates of the building. Second, the breakfast is okay but a bit limited. Lastly, we felt that the ladies at the reception are intrusive. For example, the moment we arrived, we just want a rest as we were tired but she was selling us many many things like tours or tailors and repeat many unnecessary information which was annoying for us. They keep asking questions like who is your taxi driver, where are you going, which store?.. I mean, I understand they get some kind of commision but please we are on our holiday and we decide where to buy stuff. On our last day, the lady tried to convinced us to stay one more night in their hotel and beg to give them 10 review which didnt sit well on us. We feel that it is very intrusive and not professional. ####[['We like the location of this hotel .

790,thé Wo W factor! this place is stunning it is truly spectacular with marble and semi precious rocks as wall faces and chandeliers. The service is unparalleled, with attention to your every need. I loved the spa and foodies should try the restaurants and cafes, one is Michelin rated. the Chinese restaurant is famous for its dim sims and I loved their red rice rolls. I had so much fun there I barely left the hotel. This place makes other 5 star places look like 2 star. I had a room on 36 level so if you don’t like heights let them know when you book. the price is reasonable for what they offer. I would definitely stay there again i like open windows but obviously that’s not possible on 36 level. ####[['this place is stunning it is truly spectacular with marble and semi precious rocks as wall faces and chandeliers', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The service is unparalleled , with attention to your every need', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['I loved the spa and foodies should try the restaurants and cafes , one is Michelin rated', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['the Chinese restaurant is famous for its dim sims and I loved their red rice rolls', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['I had so much fun there I barely left the hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['This place makes other 5 star places look like 2 star', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['I had a room on 36 level so if you don ’ t like heights let them know when you book', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['the price is reasonable for what they offer', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['I would definitely stay there again', 'Loyalty', 'Positive']]

139420,The cruise was efficient with nearly everything run on time. The food was of a good standard - with all the meals provided there is very little to worry about. You won’t go hungry either - plenty on offer at all times. The staff were friendly and happy to help throughout our stay. This is true of the guide we had on our second day (of three). We were the only guests to stay on for 2 nights (although note there is always a combination of single and 2 night guests) so our second day was just us - perfect! We had arranged transfers with La Regina and both arrived on time and took us where we needed to go. The room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning (very necessary for Westerners visiting Vietnam in July!), lovely bed and private balcony. All the trips had what we needed to participate too. This is not a romantic or quiet cruise; if you want that, I’d look somewhere else.

This a wooden traditional house with wooden beams and clay roof tiles. It was constructed for three generations to live together so there rooms for families and guests, and some guests sleep on the floor with mat. The balcony is huge and have traditionally solid wood chairs. The Homestay is surrounded with peaceful. So it is very interesting and to experience the Vietnamese traditional way of living.

Personnel is so nice and attentive, thank you for the young receptionist lady for many great conversations. The suite was beautiful and spacious, even has a kitchen. It was nice to have breakfast in the room. You can choose to have brekkie by the pool, in the lobby area or in your room. They even made sure to offer us glutenfree breakfast. Pool is quite small but in a nice area with sauna and steamroom which you can turn on yourself. Shower / toilet have been built against a huge rock, which makes the area quite unique. The spa upstairs is great, the massage therapists are very good, and one spa treatment is included in the room price. With the free shuttle bus you can go anywhere in the town. Motorbike can be parked in the parking hall. Whoever built the Wind hotels concept knows a lot about excellent customer service and customer retention. We definitely want to go back and can highly recommend this hotel to everyone!

1943,I loved this hotel. It's in an excellent location, really convenient for the old quarter. The hotel is situated at the end of a little alley so it is away from the noisier streets. There is an excellent choice of breakfasts with a choice of a cooked option which you can have with a big plate of mixed fruits, fresh fruit juice and tea/coffee. Great hot water shower and a clean, comfortable room. Peter goes out of his way to keep his guests happy and sorted out my onward bus journey for me.

1010,I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential. With its prime location opposite the beach, attentive staff, and impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products, my overall experience was positive. While the hotel showed promise in many aspects, the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay. I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel's recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time. It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences. However, considering the hotel had only been operational for two weeks, this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy. ####[['I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['its prime location opposite the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['attentive staff', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products , my overall experience was positive', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel ' s recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time", 'Service', 'Negative'], ['It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy', 'Service', 'Neutral']]

544,Nice looking room, spacious with a bath. Our mistake not to check but about 1. 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started. This is a really noisy place, the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning (5. 30am) people using power tools. There are rodents in the roof. The bathroom looks great but the water doesn't flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over. The bath is really nice, but the hot water only fills about 1/5 of it at a time. Not that we would have used it, as it was too cold, but the pool was empty. Staff at reception were unwelcoming, didn't provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don't speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also, so made it hard to communicate at all. An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren't asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine, but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc. let alone wanted something else. We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves. When we realised this wasn't going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out. We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left. No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty because the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were 'unlaunderable' and had to pay 180,000 dong to replace them! So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins. So, this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam and don't recommend it at all. If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access. ####[['Nice looking room , spacious with a bath', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Our mistake not to check but about 1 . 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['This is a really noisy place , the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['people using power tools', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['There are rodents in the roof', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The bathroom looks grea', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["the water doesn ' t flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The bath is really nice', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the hot water only fills about 1 / 5 of it at a time', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Not that we would have used it , as it was too cold , but the pool was empty', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["Staff at reception were unwelcoming , didn ' t provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don ' t speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also , so made it hard to communicate at all", 'Service', 'Negative'], ["An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren ' t asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine , but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc . let alone wanted something else", 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["When we realised this wasn ' t going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out", 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were ' unlaunderable ' and had to pay 180 , 000 dong to replace them", 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["don ' t recommend it at all", 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access', 'Amenity', 'Negative']]

138933,One word : AMAZING. This place looks like paradise on earth. Let me tell you everything you have to know about it. 1/ Moc Home is A Big house, with a pool, and a garden in the most beautiful mountains of Vietnam . I arrived at night so I could not see the landscape but when I woke up and look throw the window I was shocked about how beautiful the place was. The house in itself is super convenient and if you go to the first floor you can have a wonderful view. There are many comfortable sits that allow you to take a nap while watching those famous rice fields. 2/ The owner, Emma, who can speak English, has been absolutely lovely with me ! She helped me in so many ways and made me feel at home which is a wonderful feeling when you are far away from your country. You can ask her to help you to plan your future destination (call a taxi, car etc….) which is super useful especially in Vietnam. 3/ Everything is super clean : the bathrooms, toilets, kitchen, rooms, beds etc so it feels like you are in a really nice hotel. 4/ The food was delicious so I recommend you to eat there from time to time (the breakfast (I have chosen pancakes) was really good and the cooker prepared the best tomato tofu of my life. ####[['This place looks like paradise on earth', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Moc Home is A Big house , with a pool , and a garden in the most beautiful mountains of Vietnam', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I was shocked about how beautiful the place was', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The owner , Emma , who can speak English , has been absolutely lovely with me !

140057,Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely, airy, clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea. The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city, particularly at night. The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter's birthday (highly recommend for a fun afternoon/evening) Breakfast is great in the hotel, but there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about. Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night. Be prepared though as it was very busy on all the surrounding streets, so if you don't like crowds, you'll have to see the fire-breathing from a distance !! This is isn't a criticism of the hotel, but be aware there is a lot of development going on in Da Nang and lots of construction site. On one of the days there was a lot of drilling and banging coming from a nearby site and there is a stage on the beach directly below the hotel that plays loud music most night until 11pm. Also be prepared for noise form the street outside (tooting of horns, etc) and also the fact the beach is packed at 5. 30am with people watching the sunrise. None of these things can be controlled by the hotel though and they didn't detract from our stay. In short, if you want peace and quiet Da Nang is probably not the place for you.... ####[['Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely , airy , clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city , particularly at night', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter ' s birthday", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast is great in the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

194,Staff was nice REALLY DIRTY, with many traces from other customers. The room was very small (which is ok in another context) but it didnt even have a proper window. The only window was facing a wall, so it was claustrophobic. They seem to have 2 types of rooms, the ones from the outside bulding, which I guess are the ones showing in booking, and the ones from the back building. Our room had absolutely nothing to do with the pictures! Ask them to show you the room at least before paying. It was DISGUSTING staying at this place, such an overpiced hotel! Dont waste your money here!The good rating in Booking is probably due to the staff actively asking you to put them a review of 10 when you leave…The only positive thing is the staff is helpful, even though many of them dont speak english ####[['Staff was nice', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['REALLY DIRTY , with many traces from other customers', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The room was very small', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['it didnt even have a proper window', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The only window was facing a wall , so it was claustrophobic', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['It was DISGUSTING staying at this place , such an overpiced hotel', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['Dont waste your money here', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['The only positive thing is the staff is helpful , even though many of them dont speak english', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Our room had absolutely nothing to do with the pictures', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Ask them to show you the room at least before paying', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

1364,The sea is right in front of the resort, and it's a very quiet place to stay, so if those things appeal to you, I highly recommend it. My room's wifi was not working properly. The air conditioner did not cool the room sufficiently, so it was extremely hot, and water was leaking through the AC evaporator. The staff was pleasant and helpful, but communication was occasionally difficult due to their limited English level. For example, when I was in the taxi, the driver asked them in "Vietnamese" if I could exchange money in the hotel, because I live in Korea and had korean wons, and they said yes no problem, but when I arrived, they said I had to go to Saigon (mainland Vietnam) because they don't exchange korean won in Phu quoc, which I could had already done if I had known this. Later I easily changed money on the island after leaving the hotel; I'm still not sure why they wanted to send me to Saigon. ####[['The sea is right in front of the resort', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ["it ' s a very quiet place to stay", 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['I highly recommend it', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ["My room ' s wifi was not working properly", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The air conditioner did not cool the room sufficiently', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['it was extremely hot', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['water was leaking through the AC evaporator', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The staff was pleasant and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['communication was occasionally difficult due to their limited English level', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['For example , when I was in the taxi , the driver asked them in " Vietnamese " if I could exchange money in the hotel , because I live in Korea and had korean wons , and they said yes no problem , but when I arrived , they said I had to go to Saigon', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

1163,- Tanya was a exceptional host, very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay. - Breakfast was super, a good selection of fresh items that are pre-ordered the evening before. The best pineapple juice we've ever had. Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast. - The room was huge, well thought out and as ascetically pleasing. - The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and "cute" at night - Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround. - The beach is a minutes walk away and surprisingly nice and clean. - Good number of affordable bars and restaurants (we went to Mr Hoà's Kitchen and The Tamarinde Tree, Baby Mustard) - Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies, local area. Or to cycle to Hoi An old town, busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly. - Can get a grab from the end of the road in to Hoi An old town for about 75k VND (10 minute journey), we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening. - The hotel is small and therefore the pool is, if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves - It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren't aware. - Bikes could do with some maintenance, oil, tyres, new bell etc - but this seems to be a theme in Vietnam :) ####[['Tanya was a exceptional host , very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast was super , a good selection of fresh items that are pre - ordered the evening before', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["The best pineapple juice we ' ve ever had", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The room was huge , well thought out and as ascetically pleasing', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and " cute " at nigh', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The beach is a minutes walk away', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['surprisingly nice and clean', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Good number of affordable bars and restaurants', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies , local area', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['to cycle to Hoi An old town , busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The hotel is small and therefore the pool is', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ["It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren ' t aware", 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['Bikes could do with some maintenance , oil , tyres , new bell', 'Service', 'Neutral']]

139497,The service was exceptional. You receive a welcome drink and snack when you arrive, and you receive a refreshing drink every time you get back to the hotel. Every evening, you can request a free foot bath which is delivered to your room. Additionally, Tuan and his team are available every minute of the day to help you out with questions, advice, little problems... Next to that, the rooms were very clean and the bed and shower were comfy. The hotel is a 5min walk from the city center, allowing for a relaxed atmosfere with beautiful scenery and nature sounds, though with easy access to the more busy city center. Free bicycles are available, as well as motorbikes for 100k/day + gas price. Transport service to the train station was easily arranged by Tuan. The mini-fridge was smelly and gave our water bottles a bad taste. Additionally, during hot days (37°C) the airconditioning was not strong enough to cool our bungalow room properly.

1232,Our room was great- large, all wood, with a balcony facing the valley and a hot tub in the bathroom. Staff were super friendly and helpful. It was a positive that the lodge was out of the city of Sa Pa, giving us lots of peace and quiet. The lodge restaurant served a wide variety of dishes and the quality was very good. It's a bit costly to get from the hotel to the town of Sa Pa - about $9 each way in taxi and although the lodge has a good view of the valley, it is built right on a main road. Can't say enough about how friendly and helpful staff were, but the level of English was often poor, and thus getting answers to questions about sites to visit, places to go, and things to do, were often confusing and contradictory. ####[['Our room was great - large , all wood , with a balcony facing the valley and a hot tub in the bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Staff were super friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['It was a positive that the lodge was out of the city of Sa Pa , giving us lots of peace and quiet', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The lodge restaurant served a wide variety of dishes and the quality was very good', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["It ' s a bit costly to get from the hotel to the town of Sa Pa - about $ 9 each way in taxi", 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['the lodge has a good view of the valley', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['it is built right on a main road', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ["Can ' t say enough about how friendly and helpful staff were", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['but the level of English was often poor', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['and thus getting answers to questions about sites to visit , places to go , and things to do , were often confusing and contradictory', 'Service', 'Negative']]

I had a hard time figuring out how to get there, better to contact the facility in advance and ask for directions. Pu Luong as far as tourism is concerned is not yet developed e. g. with already organized tours, you have to plan well for travel within and figure out what you want to see maybe ask the family for advice in advance.

1867,The resort was beautiful. Three well-kept pools set in lush greenery next to the beach. You could order food and drink to your loungers at the pool which made it feel extra special. The resort was so quiet during the day, super relaxing! Our only negative was at no fault to Cassia Cottage, but was the noise coming from neighbouring resorts and bars who blasted their music on the beach every night from sunset. It did unfortunately ruin the quiet laid back vibe of Cassia Cottage in the evening.

139855,Good location around 5 minutes from the beach. The rooftop pool had a good view across the city. The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con, comfy bed, fridge, toiletries. The hotel was very noisy. We had a large family who used the hallway and lift as a playground, with the children screaming and crying while the parents shouted up and down the hallway from 5. 30am until midnight each day. We told reception who didn't care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy. There are alarms on the hotel bedroom doors as they are awkward to close, the alarms are good for safety however the other rooms would leave their doors open with the alarms beeping from early until late which again kept us awake. The hotel is not 4*, more 2 or 3*, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating. The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily. The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up. We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym, just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment, no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill. There are lots of hotels in the area - I wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price. ####[['Good location around 5 minutes from the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The rooftop pool had a good view across the city .', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con , comfy bed , fridge , toiletries', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The hotel was very noisy', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["We told reception who didn ' t care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy", 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The hotel is not 4 *, more 2 or 3 *, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym , just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment , no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['I wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price', 'Branding', 'Negative']]

140115,the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish, the owner and the staff generally polite, friendly and helpful. i was offered free tea during check-in and check-out. good communication via whatsapp, the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in. on arrival my scooter was brought to a safe place and they also took care of my keys and gear. Unfortunately there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds. On arrival I was warned of the nocturnal noise from the street - to be fair, before paying. However, the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs, even the mattress vibrated (and that was on the 4th floor, not directly at the street and on a tuesday) - not the hotels fault, but guests should be aware of this. After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff, they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel (30k) saying it couldn't be reused anymore (!). after i asked if it's possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away, they wanted to bill me for 200k. I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet. i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules. ####[['the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the owner and the staff generally polite , friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['i was offered free tea during check - in and check - out', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['good communication via whatsapp , the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff , they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel ( 30k ) saying it couldn ' t be reused anymore", 'Service', 'Negative'], ["i asked if it ' s possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away , they wanted to bill me for 200k", 'Service', 'Negative'], ['I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules', 'Service', 'Negative']]

I kindly ask Sandy at reception if there is any place where I could change 20-30USD. She said (and that was not true) that it is Sunday so everything is closed. She offered me really bad exchange rate (quite worse then the one I got at Intecontinental a day before) and once more confirmed I can not exchange it outside. After that (lie) i went out and after 1min walk saw that there are many touristic small agencies where you can exchange money with quite better rate. I was really dissappinted because it a small cheating which simply makes all worse than it might be. So don't cheat that way - it is not ok. I came back and said that at reception.

The extra luggage can also be stored for free. They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop. The staff at the reception speaks and understands English. While the facilities are top notch, their maintenance is not upto the mark. People wear shoes in the dorms, there is nobody responsible for the lockers. There are lockers but the key is not available. I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people. They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests.

1407,The boat itself is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay. It feels magical. The staff were extremely kind and welcoming. We did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized. Kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in Vietnam. All the food was quite good and was included. But, FYI if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise. The staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood. The baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window, so you can look out at the bay, which is great. This ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay. The balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures.

1546,Location was convenient and staff were really helpful and friendly. We stayed in room 109 which was a family room. The room was extremely dark as our window looked out onto a wall and a roof top with broken air conditioner units on. We booked a family room as we were travelling with our teenage son - house keeping did not replace or restock shower gel, towels or bathroom mats during out 3 night stay. They took the dirty towels away without replacing new ones. I had to constantly ask house keeping to replace our towels. The room was dusty and there were lots of small insects in the room. No counter space in the bathroom to leave toiletries. Limited hanging space/hooks to hang wet towels. Very poor for a family room. Breakfast buffet was basic, bar staff were friendly, but had no idea how to make basic cocktails even though they were on the drinks menu. ####[['Location was convenient', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['staff were really helpful and friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The room was extremely dark as our window looked out onto a wall and a roof top with broken air conditioner units on', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['house keeping did not replace or restock shower gel , towels or bathroom mats during out 3 night stay', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['They took the dirty towels away without replacing new ones', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['I had to constantly ask house keeping to replace our towels', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['The room was dusty and there were lots of small insects in the room', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['No counter space in the bathroom to leave toiletries', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Limited hanging space / hooks to hang wet towels', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Breakfast buffet was basic', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['bar staff were friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['but had no idea how to make basic cocktails even though they were on the drinks menu', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Very poor for a family room', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

139569,We arrived late to this charming hotel, check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade. Our room was well appointed, just as pictured in the photos with a very comfortable bed. In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields. Both the ladies at reception, Xí and Vân, took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind. From helping us book taxis, tours (we booked Golden Bridge), laundry services, massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning, they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional. They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight! This hotel is located halfway between An Bang Beach and Hoi An Old Town, in a peaceful, tranquil rural setting. It’s ideally situated for day trips like basket boat tours and even Tra Que Culinary Village. We loved being able to see the farmers work the land in this authentic setting and walking to nearby little cafés. We used the free bicycles to explore the area a few times, which was very pleasant. It would be a quick 10-15 minute bike ride into town. The pool was a little too cold for us during our one week stay in February, but it was still lovely to sit around on the comfy loungers and listen to the trickling water, like a little oasis. The gentleman who works on the grounds doesn’t speak English, but he works very hard to maintain the property, is the hotel’s security, gardener and I’m sure whatever else needs doing. Our hats off to him! We Canadians highly recommend this little gem of a hotel just outside the busy area. We’d like to thank the staff at Maison Fleur Hoi An for a wonderful stay! Occasionally we had to be patient to get a Grab taxi to come and pick us up at the property as it's a little out of the way. But this is also part of why we liked the hotel. ####[['check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Our room was well appointed', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['just as pictured in the photos', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Both the ladies at reception , Xí and Vân , took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['From helping us book taxis , tours ( we booked Golden Bridge ), laundry services , massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning , they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight !

We went in mid December their winter season, and we were pleasantly surprised that the bed was heated. The decor and furnishings of the entire place were tastefully done up too, so pretty that we requested to buy some vases as souvenirs. The staffs were all very professional and polite. Food was really good too, everything we ordered was a hit. And try their signature house cocktail mix it was so good! Highly highly highly recommend to make this place your last stop in Sapa. We were a little shocked that the housekeeping team actually went into our room to clean up while we were at the dining area having our meal. It was a nice and attentive gesture but would appreciate the option for us to choose if we want the service or not, as for our personal preference, we prefer not to have housekeeping service during our stay to prevent any mishaps.

The room (double room with private bathroom) was EXTREMELY noisy - and this is coming someone who isn't very sensitive to noise/can sleep almost everywhere. I understand it's impossible for it to be completely quiet as the room faces the street and is opposite a school but better windows really need to be installed or, at the very least, thicker velvet curtains that would keep the sound out. On top of that, there was a hole in the upper pane of balcony doors. I didn't mind this so much but I know this is important to some people - the water pressure in the shower is weak. ####[['The room itself was very spacious - seating area with sofa , bed , dining table , pantry area , bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Basic toiletries and towels were provided', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Location was good - lots of food options and cafes around , not too far from the heart of D1', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Internet was reliable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['was EXTREMELY noisy', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['windows really need to be installed or , at the very least , thicker velvet curtains that would keep the sound out', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['there was a hole in the upper pane of balcony doors', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the water pressure in the shower is weak', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the room faces the street and is opposite a school', 'Amenity', 'Negative']]

138765,The resort was phenomenal!!! This was my first time visiting Vietnam with my family and after traveling from north to south, we were exhausted. At first I had booked another hotel in Phu Quoc but after reading the reviews, I canceled and booked Andochine instead. It was more $$$ but well worth it. It was a “mini vacation” within my tiring vacation. The villa had a private pool right on the beachfront. The beach was beautiful but the waves were too strong - so it was dangerous to swim. Good thing we had the private pool all to ourselves. My family really enjoyed the much needed relaxation. The bedrooms and bathrooms were very very clean. The beds were very comfortable. The basement also had a billiard room and a poker room.

138960,The pool was a god send as we had moved from another hotel in the city as it did not have a pool. Also the close proximity to the airport and free shuttle service for our departure was excellent. The pool area had no staff in attendance through out the day and I had to go down to the lobby to ask for towels to be sent up. Also there was no option to order meals/drinks at lunch time at the pool; as the staff did not start until 4pm. Again I went down to the restaurant in the lobby to ask about getting a meal & drinks sent up to the pool. I was told the only way we could do this was to order room service and take it up to the pool. So we had to return to our room, order our meal then return to the pool. In that time our towels had been removed so had to go get more towels. All this inconvenience could have been fix with either one staff member in attendance at the pool during the day or a telephone at the pool bar with instructions to call & order meals/drinks over the phone. Safety around the pool should also be consider, no staff means anything could happens up on the roof... even if there is CCTV! ####[['the close proximity to the airport', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['free shuttle service for our departure was excellent', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The pool area had no staff in attendance through out the day and I had to go down to the lobby to ask for towels to be sent up', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['there was no option to order meals / drinks at lunch time at the pool ; as the staff did not start until 4pm .

253,A Friend's Recommendation Unveils the Magic of Zizi Homestay in Sapa I am filled with immense excitement as I recount my extraordinary journey to the captivating landscapes of Sapa, Vietnam. Inspired by a friend's heartfelt recommendation, I embarked on a quest to discover the hidden treasures of this enchanting region. My adventure led me to the remarkable Zizi Homestay, and I can confidently say that it was an experience that exceeded all expectations—a journey that was truly worth every moment. Upon arriving at Zizi Homestay, I was instantly captivated by the beauty of its surroundings. Nestled amidst the awe-inspiring landscapes of Sapa, it stood as a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and culture. The gentle embrace of Zizi's warm hospitality and the sincere smiles of the Hmong people made me feel instantly at ease. It was evident from the very beginning that my friend's recommendation was a precious gift. The allure of Zizi Homestay extended far beyond its idyllic setting. It was a gateway to the vibrant tapestry of Hmong culture. With boundless enthusiasm, Zizi welcomed me into her world, eager to share the rich heritage and traditions of her community. I was invited to immerse myself in the fascinating art of batik dyeing, guided by the skilled hands of the Hmong artisans. It was a mesmerizing experience that allowed me to witness firsthand the intricate craftsmanship and the indomitable spirit woven into every stitch. Throughout my stay, Zizi proved to be an extraordinary hostess, going above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of my journey was filled with wonder and delight. From guiding me on breathtaking treks through the emerald rice terraces to introducing me to the flavors of traditional Hmong cuisine, Zizi's genuine care and passion created an atmosphere of true warmth and hospitality. ####[]

105,My family and I had a very comfortable stay at Hanoi Silk Centre hotel. The location is great. It’s in the centre of the old quarter but it’s peaceful and quiet inside. The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place. All the staff are so friendly, especially Ms Karathy and Jay. Ms Karathy booked our transfer from the airport, our trip to Ha Long Bay and was so helpful in making sure everything was sorted before we arrived. Jay made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to help us out. The day of our check out, the staff kindly allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel for the entire day until evening, when we picked up our bags to catch our overnight train to Hue. My dad accidentally left his medication in the hotel room and only realised when we got to the train station. We contacted the hotel and Jay assured us that he and the staff would find it, fortunately, they did find the medication and Jay hopped on his scooter to hand deliver the meds to us at the train station. We were so grateful that he went above and beyond and enabled us to enjoy the rest of our holiday. I hope the manager knows what fantastic staff they have, especially Ms Karathy and Jay. ####[['The location is great', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['It ’ s in the centre of the old quarter but it ’ s peaceful and quiet inside', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['My family and I had a very comfortable stay at Hanoi Silk Centre hotel', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['All the staff are so friendly , especially Ms Karathy and Jay .

Considering we also purchased the daily £22 breakfast for 2 which was pretty pricey for Vietnam I would have appreciated some form of compensation given it’s a 5 star and the issues we had - We also had to pay a £300 deposit on the room when we arrived which made no sense considering the room showed lots of signs of wear and tear ####[['We booked the hotel for the reason it was ‘ 5 star ’ and had a bath on the balcony …. when we arrived the bath for the room we were given was in a disgusting state we did not want to get in it', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['We complained and they said they ’ d clean it but when we returned to the room it looking in the same state', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['so after complaining again they moved us to a new room that was effort considering we had to repack', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['then they gave us a smaller room , with a slightly nicer bath , but still the fixtures and fittings were so old and outdated it looked grim', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['We also had to pay a £ 300 deposit on the room when we arrived which made no sense considering the room showed lots of signs of wear and tear', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['we also purchased the daily £ 22 breakfast for 2 which was pretty pricey for Vietnam', 'Service', 'Negative']]
139603,Location: 300-800m near buses, Co-Op mart, and 10-15 min walk to the main beaches. Personnel: the owner/receptionist is particularly annoying. 1. there is no price list. So she could charge anything, disregarding the Booking's price. if you don't agree she would put you in a small stuffy smoking-smelling room, not as in the picture advertised. You are not allowed to remove the tray. 2. there is no cup/glass, or kettle available to discourage eating or drinking in the room. She had a set mind and tried to rule you as much as possible such as locking away all remote controls in the draw, and telling me that" no need to touch /change them". 3. When I complained about the TV not working and the water from the basin leaking on the bathroom floor, she was very argumentative, trying to put the blame on me. Instead of examining the problems or being willing to fix the issues. She was loud and aggressive and disregarded anything I said or requested persistently. She would never stop talking, once she was in my room. 4. The first day when I arrived I gave her my ID, she did not have any question. After she got to know me in he afternoon, she asked me if I have money to lend her, I laughed and left. When I got back that night I told her that I was very sick. She did not care but kept dragging on questioning my ID , trying to cause me trouble. I was very tired and sick and she would not leave me alone. When I told her that I was willing to pack my bag and leave immediately (eventhough it was almost midnight). She then shut up, and let me go to rest. The next day, the Bell boy asked me nicely if I would stay another day as booked, and tried fixing the leaking basin. So I stayed and She left me alone since. 5. Everyday, room was not cleaned nor rubbished being collected so brought them down to reception bin, she made me to throw them outside the building site. Lastly, I forgot to collect my ID after settling the account. upon realising, I called and asked her nicely to send it to my address in Saigon. ####[['300 - 800m near buses , Co - Op mart , and 10 - 15 min walk to the main beaches', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['he owner / receptionist is particularly annoying', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["there is no price list .

Breakfast cutlery was not easily accessible. Limited vegetarian food options. Only cows milk available, soy is helpful for many. Front entry to hotel has steep and potentially slippery steps. Bathroom shower had no door, just open, much water on the floor. Only one chair in room, too little for a couple and particularly if family visit. The safety box would work initially, but then would not open.

We listened to Mai's advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted. Everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back. For trips to Sapa, I would recommend the individual cabin on the bus as this was a godsend after such a long walk, try to get the cabin near the front as the ride is smoother and take mosquito spray. Travelling with children, Mai made this much more relaxed!

I was able to leave my heavy luggage with them for 3 days, at no charge, I recommend tipping though, this is a true Homestay (they live next door), they are building it up based on our visits. Quiet and a breath of fresh air (ironically in a superhot & humid weather) compared to downtown Hoi An. 15min motorcycle ride through an amazing landscape (see photos).

1354,very clean. Staff is very nice and Family dinners were very delicious. An helped us check in really early in the morning and kept checking with us during the whole stay, which was lovely. They dropped me off at the bus station for Mui Ne which was above and beyond. This hostel isn’t the same one that all the reviews rave about because they moved during Covid. Booking’s description says there’s a patio bar and has lots of reviews talk about the roof, and at this location those don’t exist. Also, on booking. com the address is wrong (correct address as of 4/23 is Alley 1/5A, Đường Lê Hồng Phong, Phường 4, Thành phố Đà Lạt, Lâm Đồng, Vietnam) which meant that I showed up to the old hostel address at 4:30 in the morning.

1379,We had an amazing stay with a fantastic host and her parents who were helpful in every way. The hotel rooms are beautifully finished, clean and modern with a balcony to sit out in, in the evenings. The hotel is in a perfect location for An Bang Beach (15min walk away) and an hour walk to Hoi An town centre (there is the option to rent a bike or moped from the hotel for a small fee). The breakfast was amazing- the banana pancakes with condensed milk were our favourite! This has been our favourite hotel during our time spent in Vietnam and would thoroughly recommend staying here.

138544,This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it's very near the Lake, the cute little streets, restaurants, night market, you name it. When you enter the hotel, you notice that the narrow entrance - which is normal for all hotels and houses in Hanoi - opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours, furniture and benches, and the most welcoming staff. Will, the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived, explained everything about the hotel and Hanoi as if he was a tour-guide, and he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits. Will is not the only gem in this hotel, as other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness, which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect. The hotel has a lift, a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby, the rooms have great beds (thank you) and a good lay-out for the space in an inner city hotel. It also has a lovely breakfast place (beautiful decoration) with good choices of food and drinks, and again great staff. However, one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the Skybar and roomservice is the best we had in Hanoi - by far. So we hope they create an inviting restaurant or rooftop eatery that creates a place for the chef to display her/his talents. Other good things to write about are the Spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff, and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place. Vietnam is colourful, and this is reflected in the interior design. We saw tourists stay here, as well as business people and locals, so we felt right at home. The hotel could possibly offer water refill-locations so less plastic is used, but it seems that Vietnam should tackle that problem in more hotels and locations. ####[["This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it ' s very near the Lake", 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours , furniture and benches', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['and the most welcoming staff .

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel as one of the budget-friendly options in the island. They lock the front doors at night but the staff are easily contactable to open the door even at early hours of the morning. Maybe the hotel could switch to a passcode/keycard system for this as not to disturb the staff too much?Food could also be a bit better but this is not too much of a drawback for the value you are getting from your stay. The location is also not the best as there is nothing too noteworthy in the immediate area, but Grab is easily accessible to downtown 10 minutes away.

He also booked me a taxi for the early hours the next morning to go to the airport, and it was cheaper than Grab. The location is really good, in a side street very close to the historic centre with loads of bars and restaurants on the doorstep. Towels are provided as well as toothbrush, comb, shampoo and shower gel (although it was a whitening one so I avoided). It didn't seem very clean, there were two hairs on the bed that didn't belong to me. The light fittings on the wall were very dusty and one of them didn't work. The bed was not very comfy. The air conditioning did work but the unit looked ancient and it made a lot of noise. The bathroom is in need of replacing, the tiles and taps/shower were all looking very worn/rusty.

138437,This was our best accomodation in Vietnam. There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses. There are small pools with fish and water flowers, it is like in a fairy-tale. I really recommend the place. Our bathroom was in the back of the house, outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle. Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also. We arrived in february and the weather was perfect. Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area. This is perfect for nature lovers. The room itself was clean and spacious. Clean towels and linen. The young ladies at the reception are welkoming and very helpful with everything you need. They organised transportation, help with motorcicle or motorbike rental, offer info and help with everything. They are very kind. They organised us the boat tour to floating market and arranged us the transportation to their places and then to the airport in Can Tho based on our group needs. Excellent comunication with them. The place is in the rural area near Can Tho so it is interesting to explore the villages by bicicle and see how people live, make an idea of how the life in around water canals. There is a local-style minimarket at walking distance from the accomodation. If you dont ride bicicle or motorbike the area might look a bit remote. We found no other place to eat at walking distance but we reached a small town at 6 km of bicicle ride with the help of google maps where you can find everything. We bought some exotic interesting fruits there in the fruit market and brought them at the accomodation and enjoyed them in the eating area. The boat tour on the canals and at the floating market revealed a lot of pollution. Plastic waste floating everywhere. It is very sad to see that. Otherwise it is interesting to see the trade at the floating market. ####[['This was our best accomodation in Vietnam', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['There are small pools with fish and water flowers , it is like in a fairy - tale', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I really recommend the place', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['Our bathroom was in the back of the house , outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area .

139586,This is the first bad review i’ve ever written so far. We booked this hotel because they should offer a buffet breakfast and they should also have a gym. But non of them was provided. There is also almost no breakfast possibilities in the sourroundings exept pho or seafood. We booked a deluxe room in a (apparently) 4 star hotel, but the room we more like a good budget doubleroom. The queensize bed was cozy, but iz was not one double bed but 2 single beds next to each other. The room was only cleaned once during the stay of 4 days.

The pool was devine in the very hot and humid heat, particularly after walking up to the Hang Mua Temple. Amazing views but very sweaty work! We also borrowed their bikes to visit the Bich Dong Pagoda in the late afternoon. The breakfast was so plentiful - fruit, eggs, pancakes etc. We had to turn food away! They sorted out driver for our trip to the Trang An boats and we got our washing done easily. The goats on the cliff above were a delight but a bit pesky as a loose rock broke through the canopy below but within a few hours that was all fixed. Excellent service all round!

140054,From the moment I arrived until the day of my departure, the hotel's facilities and the staff's warmth and attentiveness made my stay truly unforgettable. The bed was exceptionally comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep after a long day of exploration. The modern amenities, including a well-equipped en-suite bathroom and high-speed internet access, added to the overall convenience and satisfaction of my stay. What truly this place apart, however, was the exceptional service provided by the staff. From the moment I checked in, I was greeted with genuine smiles and a warm welcome. The staff members consistently went above and beyond to ensure my needs were met promptly and efficiently. Their kindness, friendliness, and attentiveness were truly remarkable, making me feel like a valued guest throughout my stay. ####[["the hotel ' s facilities and the staff ' s warmth and attentiveness made my stay truly unforgettable", 'Experience', 'Positive'], ["The bed was exceptionally comfortable , ensuring a restful night ' s sleep after a long day of exploration", 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The modern amenities , including a well - equipped en - suite bathroom and high - speed internet access , added to the overall convenience and satisfaction of my stay', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the exceptional service provided by the staff', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['From the moment I checked in , I was greeted with genuine smiles and a warm welcome', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['he staff members consistently went above and beyond to ensure my needs were met promptly and efficiently', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Their kindness , friendliness , and attentiveness were truly remarkable , making me feel like a valued guest throughout my stay', 'Service', 'Positive']]

139990,The European architecture coupled with the cool climate really enhances the European travel experience. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Food choices were value for money. Language barrier was a challenge. Many of the staff do not speak English very well and we had spent quite a bit of time trying to understand and describing our needs to them.

739,The location is quite ok. If you intend to spend the whole day outside and don't mind a hard bed to return to, go for it. Cleanliness is ok but we spotted some ants in the room. The shower is great looks like quality shower heads! The reception is on 2nd floor so you have to lug your luggages up. The signage was also not easy to locate and it was on the "wrong side" of the road where cars cant stop in front of the accomodation. You have to lug your luggage and cross the road. The front desk couldnt speak much english and was struggling to open the door. Probably I got a part timer that night.. :D ####[['The location is quite ok', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Cleanliness is ok but we spotted some ants in the room', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["don ' t mind a hard bed", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The shower is great looks like quality shower heads', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['You have to lug your luggage and cross the road', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The front desk couldnt speak much english and was struggling to open the door', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The reception is on 2nd floor so you have to lug your luggages up', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['The signage was also not easy to locate and it was on the " wrong side " of the road where cars cant stop in front of the accomodation', 'Amenity', 'Negative']]

188,This is a new hotel and very beautiful inside...the rooms are gorgeous, the breakfast is amazing and the staff will go beyond the call of duty to assist you with your visit in Hanoi. If you are a new visitor to Hanoi, you probably will have all the questions we had and feel overwhelmed by the traffic, crossing streets, knowing how to maneuver through the city, plan trips, restaurant, etc. The staff at Hanoi Lheritage Diamond are incredible and made our stay very relaxed, supported and enjoyable. They stored some of our luggage while we were gone and that made traveling easier. I can’t say enough about staying at this hotel and the staff. It’s in a great location too.

138480,The Staff were excellent. Ever willing to help. I would easily offer 5 Stars for the staff alone. The Location i not suitable for my purpose. Approximately 11km from the City centre. 11km in Hanoi is not 11km like my country where traffic is smoother. It would be more suitable for those who has business nearby. Surrounding area still much to be desired. As for Quality of Rooms its Excellent. For a Foreigner i had to rely on Ehailing or Taxi but during my stay it was a bit difficult to get one. Perhaps the Hotel should have Transport facilities for Transport. ####[['The Staff were excellent .
