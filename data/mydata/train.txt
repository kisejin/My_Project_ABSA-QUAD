139759,Ideally located (10 minutes walk from Van Long nature reserve - however see negative comments below), exceptionally beautiful and well maintained grounds, excellent breakfast and the dining menu at the restaurant was very good. Rooms are more like private bungalows and were clean and comfortable. The resort, despite it's beautiful trimmings is not good value money - it's actually a greedy money grab. One particular incident left a very sour note for us. The Van Long nature reserve is literally 10 minutes walk away and the normal booking price at the ticketing office for a boatman is 70k per boat. The resort charged us over 200k per person for this "tour" for which all they did was save us the walk by dropping us with their golf cart. Their golf cart driver literally paid the ticketing office the basic fee and dropped us then came back it pick us up. So essentially we paid for the convenience of a 5 minute golf cart ride. I find this extremely greedy. A resort of this of this size should upfront be offering this information and/or even providing this drop off service for free to guests.

I had a hard time figuring out how to get there, better to contact the facility in advance and ask for directions.

There was also I mistake concerning payment, so they wanted me to pay extra at check out. I knew I had paid correctly (as stated in the booking and extra 150. 000 per night for for upgrading) When I showed them confirmation and receipts, the "case was settled" , but could have been avoided (I think) - There was also so much noise in the corridors some nights that the staff should have adressed it - JUST A QUESTION : How is management working ?####[['Had to pay extra 150 . 000 extre per night for that', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['There is a really helpful guy working ( and doing everything ) who speaks good english', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Some of the staff do not speak english', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['One or two at the reception are also far from as friendly as in most hotels I visit', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['There was also so much noise in the corridors some nights that the staff should have adressed it', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['How is management working', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['There was also I mistake concerning payment , so they wanted me to pay extra at check out', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['The rooms are " perfect " Still I chenged after 3 days to get a room with a window', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['When I showed them confirmation and receipts , the " case was settled " , but could have been avoided', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

139076,Such a beautifully designed and decorated apartment. It felt like being at home in a strange city. We even got food delivered just so we could hang out there a bit more. There's a great little coffee shop downstairs and a popular noodle restaurant on the corner. We just loved all the little touches that created a really welcoming and peaceful vibe. Our favourite place so far on this trip. The hot water didn't last as long as we would have liked and the mattress could be thicker but neither of these things detracted from how much we loved staying at My Fa House.####[['Such a beautifully designed and decorated apartment', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' It felt like being at home in a strange city', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['We even got food delivered just so we could hang out there a bit more', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['There \' s a great little coffee shop downstairs and a popular noodle restaurant on the corner', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['We just loved all the little touches that created a really welcoming and peaceful vibe', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The hot water didn \' t last as long as we would have liked and the mattress could be thicker but neither of these things detracted from how much we loved staying at My Fa House', 'Facility', 'Neutral']]

138483,For our wedding anniversary celebration, my family decided to stay at this lovely resort called Memorina. And wow, did it surpass our expectations! Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery, it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape. The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat, bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region. We spent hours wandering around the resort, discovering charming nooks, admiring the vibrant plant life, and even giving fishing a shot. One of the highlights was visiting the sheepfold – an experience that not only captivated us but also filled our kids with wide-eyed wonder. Watching their faces light up as they interacted with the sheep was absolutely heartwarming. During our stay, we were treated to a gentle evening rain, which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand. All in all, our time at Memorina etched a truly special memory in our family's journey.####[[' We spent hours wandering around the resort , discovering charming nooks , admiring the vibrant plant life , and even giving fishing a shot', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive , always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['it surpass our expectations', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['During our stay , we were treated to a gentle evening rain , which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['our time at Memorina etched a truly special memory in our family \' s journey', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

Making sure I ate and giving me fruits of they learned that I skip a meal (I wasn't hungry, but I'll take fruits anytime haha). It was warm and cosy, and felt like I was staying with a family. Also loved that it's across the river from the old town and slightly further down from the night market, so you don't get bothered by loud noises late at night, but yet near enough to walk.####[['The staff were by far the most kind and caring people I \' ve met in Vietnam so far', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They really took care of me , making sure I was okay as a solo female traveller', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Making sure I ate and giving me fruits of they learned that I skip a meal', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' It was warm and cosy , and felt like I was staying with a family', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Also loved that it \' s across the river from the old town and slightly further down from the night market , so you don \' t get bothered by loud noises late at night , but yet near enough to walk', 'Amenity', 'Positive']]

818,It is quite a modern hostel with all facilities. In fact it looks like a good hotel. There is plenty of space in the dorms, and in the restaurant area near reception. The beds are large and comfortable. In fact the beds are like a capsule, so once you close the curtain, there is full privacy. The bathrooms are sufficient and well equipped. They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop. I rented motorbike from here. They have really new and good quality bikes. The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house. They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat, cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike. The extra luggage can also be stored for free. They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop. The staff at the reception speaks and understands English. While the facilities are top notch, their maintenance is not upto the mark. People wear shoes in the dorms, there is nobody responsible for the lockers. There are lockers but the key is not available. I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people. They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests. The dorms are air conditioned, but since the beds are capsule type, there is no ventilation inside the cubicle. It would be nice if there was a separate fan for each cubicle.####[['It is quite a modern hostel with all facilities', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' In fact it looks like a good hotel', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There is plenty of space in the dorms , and in the restaurant area near reception', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The beds are large and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' the beds are like a capsule , so once you close the curtain , there is full privacy', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The bathrooms are sufficient and well equipped', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They have really new and good quality bikes', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat , cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The extra luggage can also be stored for free', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The staff at the reception speaks and understands English', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['While the facilities are top notch , their maintenance is not upto the mark', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['there is nobody responsible for the lockers', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['There are lockers but the key is not available', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The dorms are air conditioned', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' It would be nice if there was a separate fan for each cubicle', 'Facility', 'Neutral']]

1558,Beautiful open see through lobby, lovely ocean view rooms with a balcony, superb breakfast buffet, wonderful staff and service, and a playroom for the kids with an attendant. The location is perfect, in the city but quieter when compared to the main road area. We ate at the restaurant several times, the seafood buffet was good, a la carte was really good too. The spa was lovely. We were very happy with our stay at Furama. It was great overall, we were very happy with our stay, difficult to find anything wrong. To note, for a family of 2 adults + 2 children, it would make sense to book an ocean view suite rather than take a garden view room. This is because when they say 2 twin beds, it means 2 single beds in the garden room which aren't useful for 2 adults and 2 kids. So you have to take an extra bed at an added cost. Hence for a similar price, take the ocean view room which come with 2 platform sofa's which can convert to 2 kids beds and a fantastic view!

139608,The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport. The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance. Owner stays just next door so it’s easy to reach out if you have any issues provided that she’s at home. Room is comfy and clean. Aircon is a little weak but it works. Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair. Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin. Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin. Owner gave the pin to the metal gate via message through Booking. com’s app but just note that the metal gate is right in front of the apartment on the 5th floor, not the big gate on ground floor facing the street. Since the apartment is located on the 2nd street away from the main road, it’s not too noisy at night. The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries. There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe. The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift. Luckily there is a cement strip laid over the staircase which probably is meant for bicycles but it works fine to roll my small suitcase up. You’re also supposed to pay your room fee upon arrival in cash - which the fault is mine since I didn’t read carefully before booking. So be prepared to bring extra cash, or exchange money in the many shops at the night market.####[['The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ['Aircon is a little weak but it works', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Room is comfy and clean', 'Facility', 'Positive']]

The room I stayed in had no window, so it was quite stuffy, but that was expected for the price. I peeped into a renovated higher end room on that floor (the door was open because of the construction), and it looked pretty good. The fridge didn't work (no cooling effect whatsoever) and the little bottles of shower gel and shampoo in the shower seemed to all be missing the little straws inside so you cannot really use the pump on it, which was weird?!The landromat was expensive: 120. 000vnd (or more) for a load of clothes.

She also helped arrange bikes and motorbikes for us to borrow to travel to the city center and helped troubleshoot problems when needed. Overall, we were very impressed with the hospitality. We arrived by car from Da Nang and had some trouble navigating since the alley to this place was very narrow, but there was some parking space in front of the villa itself so it wasn't a problem. You will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away (free bikes, motorbikes, car - bit difficult considering the alley, or taxis and other options).Some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim - to fit the vibe. I wouldn't recommend this place for those with small children because the pool facilities and general structure of the place are not very child-friendly.####[['The place is exactly as expected from the pictures and reviews', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['The owner helped us upgrade one twin room to a family room', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' it was very spacious', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['She also helped arrange bikes and motorbikes for us to borrow to travel to the city center and helped troubleshoot problems when needed', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Overall , we were very impressed with the hospitality', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' there was some parking space in front of the villa itself ', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['You will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ['Some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['I wouldn \' t recommend this place for those with small children', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], [' the pool facilities and general structure of the place are not very child - friendly', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel as one of the budget-friendly options in the island. They lock the front doors at night but the staff are easily contactable to open the door even at early hours of the morning. Maybe the hotel could switch to a passcode/keycard system for this as not to disturb the staff too much?Food could also be a bit better but this is not too much of a drawback for the value you are getting from your stay. The location is also not the best as there is nothing too noteworthy in the immediate area, but Grab is easily accessible to downtown 10 minutes away.

1364,The sea is right in front of the resort, and it's a very quiet place to stay, so if those things appeal to you, I highly recommend it. My room's wifi was not working properly. The air conditioner did not cool the room sufficiently, so it was extremely hot, and water was leaking through the AC evaporator. The staff was pleasant and helpful, but communication was occasionally difficult due to their limited English level. For example, when I was in the taxi, the driver asked them in "Vietnamese" if I could exchange money in the hotel, because I live in Korea and had korean wons, and they said yes no problem, but when I arrived, they said I had to go to Saigon (mainland Vietnam) because they don't exchange korean won in Phu quoc, which I could had already done if I had known this. Later I easily changed money on the island after leaving the hotel; I'm still not sure why they wanted to send me to Saigon.####[['The sea is right in front of the resort', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' it \' s a very quiet place to stay', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' I highly recommend it', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['My room \' s wifi was not working properly', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The air conditioner did not cool the room sufficiently', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' it was extremely hot', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' water was leaking through the AC evaporator', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The staff was pleasant and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['communication was occasionally difficult due to their limited English level', 'Service', 'Negative'], [' For example , when I was in the taxi , the driver asked them in " Vietnamese " if I could exchange money in the hotel , because I live in Korea and had korean wons , and they said yes no problem , but when I arrived , they said I had to go to Saigon', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

1743,We had the most wonderful two nights at the viet nhat hotel. Mrs Phuong and Mr Trung were the most lovely hosts we have had during our travels. Both went above and beyond to make our stay more comfortable. We had delicious breakfasts included made by Mrs Phuong, she even gave us free dragon fruit on the side. Mr Trung was so sweet always sharing his fruit with us and when we left sent us off with apples and water bottles. He even drove us to the bus stop because we couldn’t find a grab to take us. Mrs Phuong woke up to let us in when we arrived at 1am and gave us a lovely room. They had an elevator as well which was heaven for us after being up 5 flights of stairs in Hanoi! The room was clean, spacious and had a balcony, TV and refrigerator. The hotel is right opposite the train station so easy to get to. We rented bikes from them for only 100K a day, Mrs Phuong gave me a quick lesson as I hadn’t rode for years. Overall a lovely stay and would recommend to anyone. Hosts so kind, helpful and generous as well as a lovely hotel for such a good price!

The tiled floor in the room looked spotless but under the bed there was all sort of rubbish (incl. a dead cockroach) that would fly around when the window was open. There is just one socket just on one side of the bed. The a/c pointed right at the bed head making very uncomfortable to sleep. The balcony was just 300mm deep, not made to sit outside nor hang your towel after being at the beach. The handrail was totally rusty. The view from every window of the building opens on the rubbish thrown in the perimeter land. The toliet sit is 5fingers smaller than the toilet itself. Shower water runs weak but it works incl. hot water. Very poor breakfast incl. coffee, tea, bread, ham and some fruit. Some staff members din't speak english and they din't make any effort to understand me. Once they knew I was up in the morning, the cleaning staff invaded my room ignoring if I still wanted to stay in the room. It happened to me at 8am. They made the bed pulling the top sheet but leaving the bottom one all messy from your night of sleep.

Location was ok, not that close to old quarter but ok walking distance away. Room was cleaned well, we had a complimentary fruit basket in the room. Surfaces in the room were somewhat worn out, and there was some visible water damage in the bathroom, tiles were cracked etc. You could hear all the noises from the hallway. The walls/windows were so thin, that it felt like the windows were open because the traffic noises were so loud, and it was a little hard to sleep. Update // They asked us to do a written review about the hotel upon check out. We wrote same things on that and here in the booking review. Mostly great things about the service and staff, only complaints was the noises and the fact that the room might need some updates/renovations. We waited in the hotel lobby for a car to pick us up to the airport, and the manager came to us apologizing and they gave us a 50% refund from the car service. We thought that was unnessecary, but it felt nice that they reacted to our feedback. I also wrote this booking review waiting in the lobby, usually I wait to get out of the hotel to do that, I should’ve done it now too. The manager had seen my booking review and came back to talk to us, asking us to change the review from 8 to 10. We felt super uncomfortable that he asked us to do so. We just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. For that point we had nothing but great things to say about the staff, but now it left us with a bad taste to our mouths, and this wasn’t a great ending to our 2-week trip to Vietnam, which had been nothing but lovely so far. I had to lower the grade because we didn’t appreciate this kind of doing.####[['Staff was great and super helpful .

138879,It really was a great hideaway and base for exploring Ben Tre. It is located on the quieter side of the river and way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel. The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area. The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more. The homestay itself is cute and homely, with a small shared living space that you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions. The rooms are located just behind a little stream at the back and provides total quietness. Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them! We stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view. Internet is great and we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us. It was such a lovely place to get away from HCMC for a few days. It is a great value for price! The only inconvenience (that can be easily rectified) is that as it is in the outskirt of Ben Tre you cannot reach there by public transport from HCMC. The small taxi rides are absolutely worth being in the quietness and lush green surroundings!####[['It is located on the quieter side of the river', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The homestay itself is cute and homely , with a small shared living space', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them !

519,I really liked my stay at Lam Vien Homestay as it was quaint and really comfortable. I adored getting the chance to speak with owner and learn a little more about his and Hue's history. Plus, I arrived so early and they were more accomidating me as I rented a bike and joined one of the other travellers to journey together. My room was ideal, it was on the first floor and had easy access to the bathroom and privacy if wanted. Breakfast and other things were available though I didn't partake as IO have my own dietary means and wanted to see the city which is so full of history and excitement. I finally arrived late in the evening after consuming as much of the wonder that is Hue. I came back to what was supreme quiet and excellent accommodation as I prepared myself some food and go the comfort and quiet of a evening left to my own devices. Being close to both the north and south sides of Hue, I went off to explore as I would leave reasonably early the next morning and was delighted to be so well placed. I really recommend this incredible homestay and encourage you to stay as long as you can because there is so much that makes Hue ideal to travel and experience. Thank you ever so much Nothing, liked it all.####[['I really liked my stay at Lam Vien Homestay', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['it was quaint and really comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' I adored getting the chance to speak with owner and learn a little more about his and Hue \' s history', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' I arrived so early and they were more accomidating me as I rented a bike and joined one of the other travellers to journey together', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['My room was ideal , it was on the first floor and had easy access to the bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' privacy if wanted', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast and other things were available though I didn \' t partake', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['wanted to see the city which is so full of history and excitement', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' I finally arrived late in the evening after consuming as much of the wonder that is Hue', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['I came back to what was supreme quiet and excellent accommodation', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' I prepared myself some food and go the comfort and quiet of a evening left to my own devices', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Being close to both the north and south sides of Hue', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['I went off to explore as I would leave reasonably early the next morning and was delighted to be so well placed', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['I really recommend this incredible homestay and encourage you to stay as long as you can because there is so much that makes Hue ideal to travel and experience', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['Thank you ever so much Nothing , liked it all', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

The property offers several breakfast options including eggs, pancakes or yogurt and fruit. They also do dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed a menu of chicken stir-fry, shrimp stir-fry and spring rolls at the property. Much better quality than the dinner we had in Sapa. But the gem is the gardens surrounding the property, they are absolutely stunning. There are several sitting areas to enjoy a glass of wine in the evening. In addition the staff is very helpful and accommodating. Mr. Nam Hong can arrange a guide for treks in the area and tickets for Fansipan mountain. Laundry service is also available.

She offered me really bad exchange rate (quite worse then the one I got at Intecontinental a day before) and once more confirmed I can not exchange it outside.

524,We ended up staying at the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, so I can only comment on that. Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom. We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool. Breakfast was very good and a sensible price. if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel. Very handy little shop called Moon Milk on the street corner. A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage. The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing. We landed on a (relatively) cold and rainy evening and took the long taxi ride from Da Nang airport. The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance. We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that. There was a notice on the door saying to go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, giving the address. A sketch map would have been useful! It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel. The gentleman on reception took us up to a room, leading in and coming back out very rapidly. Obviously there was some kind of problem, and he wished to be professional about it. He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card. We were ushered to another room, which was clearly an upgrade. Whilst it lacked a couple of things (such as a toilet roll, which appeared the next day), it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom.

I found her texts to be increasingly bizarre and late at night. She then told me she had a sick child and needed my help. She then offered to buy me a drink in Hanoi if I would just accept her plan to use the cheaper room. She was concerned about her job and realised she had made a big mistake. I was paying a lot of money for this cruise and did not want to move rooms. I told her it was her problem and she would have to fix it. I was traveling with friends and wanted to treat myself to a nice room on this cruise. Her constant texts caused me al lot of unnecessary stress in the days before getting on the cruise.

The whole staff team was absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel.

Please note that it's not a distance that you can't walk at all, but it'll be a burden to walk in the middle of the heat. Fortunately, you can visit various attractions in Hanoi using the grap service. The room condition is very very excellent. A comfortable bed and living room(has a comfortable sofa) are provided, and simple cooking is possible with a simple kitchen. I was able to travel comfortably because they cleaned and managed it every day. Also, there was a washing machine on the balcony, and it was so nice to be able to wash wet clothes with sweat. The product description says that there are four bathrooms in three rooms, but in reality, there are three bathrooms in three rooms. The toilet tissue location is so far away that you have to twist your body into an acrobatic way to touch the tissue. There is no space to put shampoo or soap in the shower booth. There's not enough space to put soap in the sink. In addition, it does not provide soap. Items provided include shampoo, conditioner, toothbrush, and toothpaste.####[['The breakfast served at the pantry on the 5th floor every morning was good because I could have a light breakfast', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['the soup of rice noodles is very delicious', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The location of the accommodation is near Miding , but it \' s a little far away', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['Please note that it \' s not a distance that you can \' t walk at all , but it \' ll be a burden to walk in the middle of the heat', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['you can visit various attractions in Hanoi using the grap service', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The room condition is very very excellent', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' A comfortable bed and living room', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['are provided , and simple cooking is possible with a simple kitchen', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['they cleaned and managed it every day', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['there was a washing machine on the balcony , and it was so nice to be able to wash wet clothes with sweat', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The product description says that there are four bathrooms in three rooms , but in reality , there are three bathrooms in three rooms', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The toilet tissue location is so far away that you have to twist your body into an acrobatic way to touch the tissue', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['There is no space to put shampoo or soap in the shower booth', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['There \' s not enough space to put soap in the sink', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' it does not provide soap', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Items provided include shampoo , conditioner , toothbrush , and toothpaste', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' I was able to travel comfortably ', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

The breakfast buffet had a wide selection of foods and I loved the daily activity that was offered. On Monday I attended the cooking class and made spring rolls and friend banana; Tuesday was the cocktail making class where we had a fruit gin & tonic and ginger honey lime tea.

890,The staff at the Solaria Hotel were absolutely wonderful, everyone was kind, helpful and friendly. The room (401) was at the front of the hotel with a french balcony overlooking the road, but as it was in the old quarter of the city this is normal. The reception area was comfortable, the dining room on floor 8 was bright and airy and breakfast had a good choice of fruit, yogurt, pastries and bread and a choice of cooked eggs. We had an evening meal after a long day out and it was exceptional, lots of menu choices, beautifully presented and very delicious. The hotel explains that whilst it is in a convenient part of the city, the views and space are not as good as the larger hotels but it makes up for that by providing excellent care and dedication and believe me that is exactly what they do. Nothing is too much trouble and all the staff go the extra mile to make your stay pleasurable.

1860,Breakfast had good range of choices. The location was close to places of interest. The room was of adequate size and facilities. Pleasant greetings and very good help with luggage and taxis. Breakfast cutlery was not easily accessible. Limited vegetarian food options. Only cows milk available, soy is helpful for many. Front entry to hotel has steep and potentially slippery steps. Bathroom shower had no door, just open, much water on the floor. Only one chair in room, too little for a couple and particularly if family visit. The safety box would work initially, but then would not open. Staff were needed twice to unlock the safety box.####[['Breakfast had good range of choices', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The location was close to places of interest', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The room was of adequate size and facilities', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' Pleasant greetings and very good help with luggage and taxis', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Breakfast cutlery was not easily accessible', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Limited vegetarian food options', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Only cows milk available , soy is helpful for many', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['Front entry to hotel has steep and potentially slippery steps', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Bathroom shower had no door , just open , much water on the floor', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Only one chair in room , too little for a couple and particularly if family visit', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The safety box would work initially , but then would not open', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Staff were needed twice to unlock the safety box', 'Service', 'Negative']]

138400,First impressions - amazing use of space and a great meet and greet. Breakfast - excellent, very fresh and different each day Laundry service - free and done for you, which is just great! Location - whilst not the most central location, the host got us taxi's as we couldn't use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim! We also used Google maps and the local bus, which is very cheap and reliable! So I didn't find location as issue at all. My husband loved the free gym! Whilst we did love our stay I feel it necessary to talk about what we didn't like. This place doesn't know what it wants yo be! It's guests are mainly young English teachers who actually live there medium to long term, so it's their home! We felt a bit like we were staying in their house. They are young, and with that came lots of night time noise, and socialising with friends not guests of the homestay right under our window until 2am on a couple of occasions. I expect young people to be noisy, it's normal, but I felt at the cost to other guests. This is because the place is mixed with different types of guests, and doesn't really have a true identity. This mixed with a very hard uncomfortable bed equaled a major lack of sleep for me! However, we did still enjoy our booking, but I feel this feedback is necessary for mid age guests, where noise might be an issue.####[['amazing use of space and a great meet and greet', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast - excellent , very fresh and different each day', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Laundry service - free and done for you , which is just great', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Location - whilst not the most central location', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], [' the host got us taxi \' s as we couldn \' t use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['My husband loved the free gym', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' we did love our stay', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['we did still enjoy our booking', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

They only have four for I think 27 levels and one of them wasn’t working. Sometimes it took ten minutes until an elevator arrived. Breakfast is good but they only serve it from six to nine. And especially from eight to nine it is extremely crowded. The food in the in-room dining menu was only okay. From a five star hotel I expect much better food. What was also really annoying that you can’t charge anything to your room.

1029,Our stay at Azerai was great. The staff were friendly and super attentive, and the facilities were nice and new. From the moment we were picked up, we were very well taken care of. One minor issue of an old razor being found in our room was made up for with a room upgrade. Food in the restaurant was good, albeit a little pricey but options in Can Tho were easy to access. The staff were great in recommending various places to visit. The highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local’s house while we waited for the rain to pass. Everything was super genuine and authentic - The guide, also a resort employee, grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing! Lastly the hotel transfer from Ho Chi Minh City was excellent - a comfortable limousine van which made the two hour trip each way enjoyable. Would recommend to visit, and stay in the Lake rooms. We started in the Garden Room, but the view from the Lake Room is better. If possible try avoid the weekends and local school holidays as the resort is much quieter. It was overall GREAT value for money, however the experiences/tours and the restaurant were a bit on the pricier side.####[['Our stay at Azerai was great', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The staff were friendly and super attentive ,', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['the facilities were nice and new', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' From the moment we were picked up , we were very well taken care of', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Food in the restaurant was good , albeit a little pricey but options in Can Tho were easy to access', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The staff were great in recommending various places to visit', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local ’ s house while we waited for the rain to pas', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Everything was super genuine and authentic', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The guide , also a resort employee , grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' made the two hour trip each way enjoyable', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Would recommend to visit , and stay in the Lake rooms', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['We started in the Garden Room , but the view from the Lake Room is better', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['If possible try avoid the weekends and local school holidays as the resort is much quieter', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], [' It was overall GREAT value for money', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['however the experiences / tours and the restaurant were a bit on the pricier side', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['Lastly the hotel transfer from Ho Chi Minh City was excellent - a comfortable limousine van', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['One minor issue of an old razor being found in our room was made up for with a room upgrade', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

1516,This is a cozy family home that has everything you need. Don't expect anything too fancy though. As a solo travel who usually stays at hostels, it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel. The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening. The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I've stayed at. Bathroom was shared but was always empty. The private room also locks. Everything I could ask for! Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market. The stairs inside the home are a little challenging. The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small (I had to navigate them going down with my feet sideways). Fortunately, my room was on the first level above ground, but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you. Also, finding the apartment was a little tricky. Finding the address of the building was fine. Take the concrete stairs up a flight and go down the first hall to your right. There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it's easy to miss. I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end, but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn't confirm if I was at the right place. I left but ended up being redirected back to the apartment. The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English. The whole family is lovely, but it can be hard to find the apartment.####[['This is a cozy family home that has everything you need', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I \' ve stayed at', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Bathroom was shared but was always empty', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The private room also locks', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Everything I could ask for', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' The stairs inside the home are a little challenging', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' finding the apartment was a little tricky', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['my room was on the first level above ground , but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['The whole family is lovely', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' it can be hard to find the apartment', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end , but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn \' t confirm if I was at the right place', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it \' s easy to miss', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

There is also almost no breakfast possibilities in the sourroundings exept pho or seafood. We booked a deluxe room in a (apparently) 4 star hotel, but the room we more like a good budget doubleroom. The queensize bed was cozy, but iz was not one double bed but 2 single beds next to each other. The room was only cleaned once during the stay of 4 days.

1294,We stayed at Golden Holiday for a few days, in a total of 3 rooms. I'm going to give you lots of details about our stay, so you can see if it is right for you. Short story - we really enjoyed it!First the rooms - rooms are quite large, with very nice sheets, towels, pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers. We're not talking super high-end, but for the price the rooms are great. Some rooms have a small sofa - ask if your room has one, or request one. Wi-fi worked great> Toilets worked well, with nice bidets attached. If you want a large, comfortable room - I don't think you can go wrong here. Staff - staff are great. This place is well staffed, there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk, always willing to go out of their way for you. Especially Thuy and Ms. Kim - they are fantastic and will help make your stay very enjoyable. They often called "electric shuttles" for us, which worked well for transporting 5 people from 1 - 3km away. Breakfast - there is a large breakfast buffet available every day from 7 to 10AM. Ours was included in the room rates. There was great coffee, also fruits, salads, asian, and some western items. Some days there were bacon and chocolate crossaints. You could always get eggs cooked anyway you liked. No pancakes or waffles, but I don't think these are very common in Vietnam. It was easy to grab some pastries to go from the breakfast buffet so you had some snacks for later on. Pool - there was a medium sized pool outside. It was nice, clean - not super huge but large enough to do laps in it. Location - it is located right on a semi-busy street, but we never heard noise from our rooms, as it is set back a bit from the road. There are plenty of spas and restaurants in the area - but you are outside of the super busy, noisy "old town" tourist area. It is a quick 5 min electric shuttle ride ($2 usd) or a 22 minute walk to the main "old town" walking areas.####[['we really enjoyed it', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' rooms are quite large , with very nice sheets , towels , pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['We \' re not talking super high - end , but for the price the rooms are great', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Some rooms have a small sofa', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' Wi - fi worked great', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Toilets worked well , with nice bidets attached', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['staff are great', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['This place is well staffed , there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk , always willing to go out of their way for you .

301,Miku is the best host I had in all 3 weeks of vietnam. Her cooking is amazing, her English is great and she’s very attentive with great conversation. She has lots of great advice about the local area and her hostel/ rooms / home are much cheaper than surrounding ones, but the quality is actually better. She deserves more custom so let’s get her some more decent reviews ( we stayed at Hmong homestay and surelee homestay *all three are in close proximity* but Miku’s was by far our favorite).

252,A lovely place with extremely friendly staff. Our room is spacious, clean, and comfortable. Facilities are brand new and neat.

1042,We did an extensive review (in person as well) of all the hotels in the area and I would say this one is the best one. The design of the hotel is super nice, with a very warm and crafty feeling! The views are absolutely gorgeous. The rooms are big and comfortable. I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics. The room was clean, bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white. The maintenance of the hotel is not the best, which is a real pity, because it was designed so nicely. When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage. The hot water is very inconsistent when showering, sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself! Some staff is nice, others not so much. I think the language barrier is the biggest problem because almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude, which I don't think it's their intention. I would suggest the management trains the people a bit better.####[['The design of the hotel is super nice , with a very warm and crafty feeling', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' The views are absolutely gorgeous', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The rooms are big and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The room was clean , bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The maintenance of the hotel is not the best , which is a real pity , because it was designed so nicely', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage .', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The hot water is very inconsistent when showering , sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' Some staff is nice', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude', 'Service', 'Negative'], [' I think the language barrier is the biggest problem', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['I would suggest the management trains the people a bit better', 'Service', 'Neutral'], [' all the hotels in the area and I would say this one is the best one', 'Branding', 'Positive']]

That lead to lot of discussion with that person (about sunscreen making the yellow stains, but there were more on the clothes after than before it). In the end, we still had to pay for everything and half our clothes are ruined.

139969,The staff could not have been friendlier! We were invited to spend Tet with the entire family (there was only about 30 of them) and they were all lovely. The bed was very comfortable and came with a mosquito net around it. The rooms were small but no more than what we needed, with numerous hooks on the wall. Breakfast was also very nice. It was located on the outskirts of Du Gia and, therefore, relatively far away from everything. The walls don't connect with the ceiling so you can hear almost everything from the other rooms, and from outside (including many roosters).####[['The staff could not have been friendlier', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['We were invited to spend Tet with the entire family', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The bed was very comfortable and came with a mosquito net around it', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' The rooms were small but no more than what we needed , with numerous hooks on the wall', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Breakfast was also very nice', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' It was located on the outskirts of Du Gia and , therefore , relatively far away from everything', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['The walls don \' t connect with the ceiling so you can hear almost everything from the other rooms', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

139544,I stayed more than a week and wow, the service of the staff all the way from Mary the general manager, to Eric and the others at the front desk was super and exceeded my expectations. It was Ritz Carlton level service. Breakfast was perfect, delicious and so many options, they also have an espresso machine but that’s extra (regular coffee and tea is free). There is such kind staff in the breakfast, so attentive to be sure the guests are comfortable and happy. My bed and pillows were so comfortable (standard double room) and a really nice marble shower. I did not have a window but i wouldn’t have opened it bc the a/c was on and i wouldn’t want to let mosquitos in. The room did not need a window, it felt very open and nice and very sweetly furnished — the designer of the hotel had very good taste. Especially the huge fuchsia colored chandelier in the lobby!

We often spent over one hour to having breakfast in the restaurant. The quality of the room is excellent, Although my room was not very large, it is very clear and provided with drinks, coffee and tea bags and fruits. During the Lunar new year holiday, Hotel celebrated the new year with the Red packet and biscuits! Also, we could book the transportation to the airport, all payment can be settled in the front-desk. The price is fair. The staff could confirm everything with us the date before our departure.

140206,Halong Bay is a must when you travel to Vietnam, and there are many options out there. We did a lot of research on the number of days to stay on the boat and also, which company to use. We opted for Le Theatre cruise 2 days 1 Night (2D1N), because of the itinerary and the activities. The boat itself is very luxurious and you feel like a star when the crew welcomes you on board. The cruise was not busy and so we had the chance to be upgraded to their best suite, for free! Views were absolutely incredible from that room. The food in the evening is also good, attention to the details was appreciated. Highly recommend this company, as it is one of our highlights of our trip. Make sure to book the luxury limousine transport from Hanoi to the boat, it's worth it!!!

If you are staying in this hotel, I highly recommend booking the combined basket boat tour and cooking lessons with Mr Cu. It was fun for us. We were upgraded to the top floor but the room was not clean e. g. candy wrappers from previous guest, mirror is not clean and the bathroom has molds. We asked to be transfered to another room and they did. The next room was okay but I woke up in the middle of the night smelling molds again. I hope they will make some updates of the building. Second, the breakfast is okay but a bit limited. Lastly, we felt that the ladies at the reception are intrusive. For example, the moment we arrived, we just want a rest as we were tired but she was selling us many many things like tours or tailors and repeat many unnecessary information which was annoying for us. They keep asking questions like who is your taxi driver, where are you going, which store?.. I mean, I understand they get some kind of commision but please we are on our holiday and we decide where to buy stuff. On our last day, the lady tried to convinced us to stay one more night in their hotel and beg to give them 10 review which didnt sit well on us.

Motel is easy to locate on Google Maps, situated next to a beach with PLENTY of seafood restaurants to choose from. Mr Danh is very friendly and an excellent host - he also speaks good English so communication was no problem. Mr Danh actually lives in the community, so he provided great guide to the local eateries and roads which was useful for us. Our room had very clean and shiny tiled floors, large bathroom with great water pressure and heated water. Air-conditioning worked very well.

544,Nice looking room, spacious with a bath. Our mistake not to check but about 1. 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started. This is a really noisy place, the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning (5. 30am) people using power tools. There are rodents in the roof. The bathroom looks great but the water doesn't flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over. The bath is really nice, but the hot water only fills about 1/5 of it at a time. Not that we would have used it, as it was too cold, but the pool was empty. Staff at reception were unwelcoming, didn't provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don't speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also, so made it hard to communicate at all. An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren't asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine, but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc. let alone wanted something else. We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves. When we realised this wasn't going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out. We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left.

Surelee, the owner has to change a little bit her attitude. I understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude. Her property, which she named a "homestay", doesn't quite reflect what a homestay should be, since, being Italians and having Italian dishes on the menu, we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused.

139572,Bamboo Farmstay is where I enjoyed the most authentic Vietnamese hospitality experience of my entire trip. The owner, Nam, his sister, and the entire family were extremely kind, attentive, and caring throughout our stay. Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh, but I insisted on paying for it, as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me. Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex, a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future. I highly recommend visiting this area now, before the crowds descend. Nam's farmstay is a hidden gem, and I'm glad I chose it over other homestays that were located in a cramped area with a challenging road. This farmstay, on the other hand, is situated on a good road, close to the main thoroughfare that leads to two of Ninh Binh's main attractions: the pagoda and the river tour. The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent, and the Vietnamese cuisine they serve is simply delicious. Although they normally close at 9 PM, they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry. While the rooms are quite basic, they offer air conditioning and hot showers, and for the price, they are an unbeatable deal - under $10 per night! You'll also have the chance to stay in a charming bamboo bungalow, which is a real treat. All in all, I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future. I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience.####[['The owner , Nam , his sister , and the entire family were extremely kind , attentive , and caring throughout our stay', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh , but I insisted on paying for it , as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex , a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['I highly recommend visiting this area now', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Although they normally close at 9 PM , they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['While the rooms are quite basic , they offer air conditioning and hot showers , and for the price , they are an unbeatable deal - under $ 10 per night', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], [' I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience', 'Loyalty', 'Positive']]

The rooms are spacious, nice and cosy, good smell, and the beds are super comfortable. I really liked the storage arrangment. I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that! The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom. First, it was located on the bottom floor seperated from all the rooms in the hostel. The way there is exposed with no ceiling. On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom. I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way. The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well. As it is raining quite often in Sapa I think that's a problem... also there's only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel. Another thing to mind is the location - it's about 10-15 min. climb up the hill from town.

139432,The room was spacious and had very wide windows, it was so pleasant to look at the view. The bathroom was also clean and spacious. It has lots of hangers which was very useful for our winter jackets. They also had Netflix on the TV right in front of the bed, which made this place felt more homey. The elevator was small but worked just fine. I've read some reviews that you need to go up through small stairs, but that happened if your property is at 11th floor above. Ours was in 10th so it was fine. The host was very communicative and supportive during our stay. p. s. They also had motorbike rent, but manual only. The bed was a bit thinner that usual bed, so it was not as comfy as your common hotel bed, but we slept just fine. The blanket was very comfortable though so it helped. The ceiling was a bit low and the room was a bit older than the photos, but it was fine. There's no good food around the place and it was about 10 mins by motorbike from Old Quarter. So, you have to rent motorbike if you wanna go to the nearest popular spots.

There is a lift to ground floor but you then need to go down another 2 set of stairs to get to the pool. Not good for people in wheelchairs or with mobility issues. I ended up having to go outside and walk down driveway to get to pool. Repeatedly asked to get mini fridge replaced in one room but they had no idea. Kept saying yes and everyday it still didn't work. Gave up after 3 days. The breakfast was quite good. Had a variety of food for buffet and even on the day they did a la carte there was a good choice. Only a 10 min walk to night market. The pool looked nice and the kids enjoyed it. They do supply a towel for swimming. They need more people that can understand English at the front desk. Not sure I would use it again but it was fairly cheap.

Staff could not speak any english. Communication was poor. Often there was no one at reception. We booked a bus through reception for nha trang and were told it was going to leave at 8. 30am. We were told we could pay with credit card on leaving. We were told in four different times that the bus would leave at 8. 30am. In the morning when we were leaving we could not have a shower because the water was cold. When we got to reception at 7. 15am we were told that the bus was leaving at 7. 40 am. Then we were told that we had to pay the hotel and bus fare in cash. After finalising the bill the staff grabbed our bags and took off from the hotel and said we had to hurry for the bus. He then disappeared into the street somewhere with our bags. We could not see him anywhere. Finally we saw him up the road dragging our bags. Eventually we got to the bus and an argument between the driver and staff because we were late. When we arrived in nha trang we had notification from booking. com that we had stayed for two days instead of the three days that we had booked. We contacted booking. com who sorted this issue quickly. This hotel and staff appears to be dishonest.

1863,Very modern and comfortable with great spa bath if you wish, nice big TV with Netflix, look there is no breakfast but it is a great area with loads of fantastic cheap eaterys close by, cheap as Banh mi which is a great breakfast staple. Nice lake at the end of the street with great coffee shops on the opposite side. Great to support the local venues and get away from the touristy hot spots. I thoroughly recommend this hotel and can't believe it isn't at least 4 stars. It is a little away from the main area but if you don't mind riding a scooter and really getting lost in the city and realising how much that has to offer or catching a grab taxi it is really worth while.

The breakfast was wonderful with so many choices in the lovely room overlooking the lake and old town Hanoi.

Anthony, Leo, and Simon were particularly helpful at the front desk with anything we needed. Staff goes above and beyond to care for you. This was the perfect place to start and end our month long journey in Vietnam. This was my second stay and I did not like the bathtub/shower combo unit in my room this time.

138475,They were all very nice, and the hotel is really central. We arrived late at night, so we asked for a transfer from the airport. The lady was very nice to us, but we realised that we would pay 400. 000 vd, which is a lot for this transfer from the airport. (If we had gone by taxi, we would pay only around 130. 000 vd...) When we got to the hotel, a really nice man was there to receive us. The small room that we booked had no windows, so we upgraded to the bigger room. The hotel is OK, not fancy (we have to watch out for the cockroachs), but it's really central, and we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night, and also the air-conditioning machine outside (which is normal in Vietnam). When we were leaving, we asked the man if he could please call a taxi, and we expected no more fees from the hotel. Until we realised that the lady came to collect our money, saying that her car would take us to the airport (for 220. 000 vd). Of course, it was not her car, and she paid the taxi and got a fee from our money. We're not sure how much she paid the taxi, but it should be around 120. 000 vd, and the rest of the 100. 000 vd went to her pocket. It wasn't correct of her, and we felt robbed.

1137,The location in the Old Quarter was fantastic and close to everything. The street at the front of the hotel is closed at the weekend, so you may struggle to be dropped outside. This really isn't a problem! All staff were fantastic. There are so many trips and variations on offer and so it was difficult to know what was best for the budget. We listened to Mai's advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted. Everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back. For trips to Sapa, I would recommend the individual cabin on the bus as this was a godsend after such a long walk, try to get the cabin near the front as the ride is smoother and take mosquito spray. Travelling with children, Mai made this much more relaxed! We would recommend the Met restaurant close to the hotel.####[['The location in the Old Quarter was fantastic and close to everything', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The street at the front of the hotel is closed at the weekend , so you may struggle to be dropped outside', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['All staff were fantastic', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['We listened to Mai \' s advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back', 'Service', 'Positive']]

Hai - the host is quite a barista and brews very good Italian coffee. The family dog Gung - is very friendly and welcoming. The hosts were very welcoming and generous - even offering to help with our laundry. I would without a doubt recommend this place to stay. Note: The location is ~ 2 kms from city centre and dining options. So you will need a motorbike/cycle to get there. The property will be able to help with those options.

It started off with little bit of a snatch theft incident and a police report - their staff stayed with us through all 5 hours and translated everything with the police (thanks Shuang!!). The owners of the hotel, a sweet pair of aunty and uncle, tried to make up for it by packing a small picnic for our Mua Cave visit.

140102,Staff were friendly, helpful, polite. We ended up booking Hà Long Bay tour, Sapa trekking tour, and Nimh Binh with them for the convenience and price.

Luckily for us, we had time. The location is great and we used this hotel as a base as we did 1-3 day trips around Hanoi. They were great with communication and super accommodating. Highly recommend as a good accomodation for the cost. Hotel construction started at 7:30-11am and we weren't warnded/informed. They were very apologetic about it and we are totally understanding as they have to do it at some point. It would just be considerate to let guests know beforehand (and I have given this same feedback on their checkout form).Still, the room is nice and I would come back to stay here!

1617,Great views. Great location. Awesome pool with swim-up bar. Super comfortable bed. Surprisingly quiet at night. Staff are all amazingly polite, professional, and friendly. Great buffet breakfast options (Eastern and Western). Only a 5-minute walk to the night market. Family friendly. Couple friendly. A little pricey, but it's a luxury resort, so that's to be expected.

1467,This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach. The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach, but since the beach wasn't very busy, you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across. The resort itself is extensive but it doesn't feel too large; it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends, so these times are busy. The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps. There are plenty of beds around that pool and you can have drinks there. The restaurant is good, so spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option. The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration. On the whole, the design of the place is amazing, with plenty of Koi carp ponds, wooden carving, well-maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms. The staffs were amazing and it's really nice to talk to them (thank you Ann!). What has been the best for us was the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil, a nice pool, the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well (Covid had closed that down). It's worth it staying there for a week or more if you're looking for a relaxing pool/beach holiday, but for food you have to either use their restaurant, or use a few local restaurants nearby - or go into town, of course (which you have to as Hoi An is an amazing, but touristy, town!) It's not so much what we didn't like, but maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well. Also, the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient, but the last one back from town is at 17. 30, so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back, which is a bit of a hassle when it gets busy.####[['This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['the design of the place is amazing , with plenty of Koi carp ponds , wooden carving , well - maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' The staffs were amazing and it \' s really nice to talk to them', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil , a nice pool , the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' It \' s worth it staying there for a week or more if you \' re looking for a relaxing pool / beach holiday', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well', 'Service', 'Neutral'], [' the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient , but the last one back from town is at 17 . 30 , so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The resort itself is extensive', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There are plenty of beds around that pool', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The restaurant is good', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' you can have drinks there', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the beach wasn \' t very busy , you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends , so these times are busy', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

52,The hotel itself is quite a nice looking building. It's in Da Nang, and the staff are pretty nice! The shower is big and the water pressure is good. Decent place to work as well, because of the good Wi Fi. The price was amazing. Really incredibly cheap for what you get. The bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet, there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed, the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area. I'm not sure if it was a residential building as well, but there was a family staying on our floor that had two rooms, and left the door open between them, yelling very loudly in the hallway at all hours. Overall it was just not relaxing or comfortable. I can't hold anything against the staff, but my experience here was dreadful. I'm sorry. But I do hope my feedback goes somewhere, since there are positive aspects to the hotel too.####[[' the staff are pretty nice', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The shower is big and the water pressure is good', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Decent place to work as well , because of the good Wi Fi', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The hotel itself is quite a nice looking building', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The price was amazing', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Really incredibly cheap for what you get', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet , there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['Overall it was just not relaxing or comfortable', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['my experience here was dreadful', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['I can \' t hold anything against the staff', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['since there are positive aspects to the hotel too', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['I \' m not sure if it was a residential building as well , but there was a family staying on our floor that had two rooms , and left the door open between them , yelling very loudly in the hallway at all hours', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

139420,The cruise was efficient with nearly everything run on time. The food was of a good standard - with all the meals provided there is very little to worry about. You won’t go hungry either - plenty on offer at all times. The staff were friendly and happy to help throughout our stay. This is true of the guide we had on our second day (of three). We were the only guests to stay on for 2 nights (although note there is always a combination of single and 2 night guests) so our second day was just us - perfect! We had arranged transfers with La Regina and both arrived on time and took us where we needed to go. The room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning (very necessary for Westerners visiting Vietnam in July!), lovely bed and private balcony. All the trips had what we needed to participate too. This is not a romantic or quiet cruise; if you want that, I’d look somewhere else. The boat was full when we went and most of the other guests were quiet loud Vietnamese on holiday (it may differ at other times of the year). Personally, we don’t like timetables / schedules so didn’t warm to the frequent announcements but we did get all the activities we were promised. We didn’t get the “welcome drinks” mentioned in the original information but a minor thing.####[['everything run on time', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The food was of a good standard - with all the meals provided there is very little to worry about', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The staff were friendly and happy to help throughout our stay', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['We had arranged transfers with La Regina and both arrived on time and took us where we needed to go', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning ', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['lovely bed and private balcony', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['We didn ’ t get the “ welcome drinks ” mentioned in the original information', 'Branding', 'Negative']]

There is a rooftop bar with happy hour and a view from the 5th floor. The other bar is in the lobby. My room offered much more than I expected: apart from safe, TV, hairdryer and water kettle, there is a fridge, free water, tea, coffee and fruits. The bed is so comfortable you don't want to get out, as is the linen and towels from very good quality. Enough plugs to recharge your electronic equipment. Lights are also good and enough. Bathroom with all amenities. Of course there is an elevator in the house. The location is great. The staff speaks good English and is more than helpful in any way. I rate 5 Stars hotel but cosy and very personal.

1906,Dear Homestay friends, I like to tell you that my husband and myself deeply appreciated your hospitality and helpfulness. During our days there, I got pretty sick one day and I did not feel well at all. Two of your wonderful employees took special care of me until I was feeling better. I am very thankful and I felt in good hands, since there was no doctor available. We really enjoyed this great place to stay, as well as all there is in the area to see and experience, on and along the river.

The hotel owner was also lovely, she even gifted us on departure, which is a beautiful and very appreciated gesture .The team of staff are very small and we’re mostly all lovely. The rooms were beautiful and way above the standard of what we paid. Breakfast was good there were both western and plenty of Vietnamese options, but the fruit selection in the morning was always fresh and plentiful. The staff always ask if you want anything special cooked for breakfast and went out of their way to order us yummy pho for breakfast (they don’t usually have this on the menu. The pool is actually bigger than what we expected and was made great use of during the hot Hoi An summer heat . Overall excellent value for money There wasn’t a lot to fault about this hotel. If I have to be picky, it was probably further away from market then we imagined. But it was extremely hot when we were there,and we aren’t game enough for motorcycles, so it may have felt further away then it was . Vihn (I think that’s his name , the only male front concierge) can work on his customer service skills.

Our room was spacious and well thought out, and I appreciated the commitment to environmentalism such as reusable glass bottles for water (instead of plastic water bottles like most hotels). The service was warm, efficient, and attentive, and everyone spoke English fluently. The pool is small and shallow, so it is only good for lounging around and sunbathing. There were limited options at breakfast, which was just ok. That was not a huge issue, though, because we wanted to explore the food in the city. Wifi was spotty, but we noticed that the internet service at most hotels in Vietnam were like that.####[[' Our room was spacious and well thought out', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The service was warm , efficient , and attentive , and everyone spoke English fluently', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The pool is small and shallow , so it is only good for lounging around and sunbathing', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['There were limited options at breakfast , which was just ok', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['Wifi was spotty', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

The cleaning service was very good, our towels were changed daily, rooms were cleaned and the water supplied daily. We could use bikes to reach Old Town, but you can easily walk there and enjoy this part of Hoi An as much as you wish. The pool was ok. not too big though but it was refreshing to be able to use it after our short trips. It was very hot during our stay and the pool was a blessing. It was quiet and peaceful at night too. The coffee was good too! The location although very close to town is also in a close proximity to a rather noisy bridge - a metal crate bridge for scooters and you can hear the noise when you use the pool.

Personnel is so nice and attentive, thank you for the young receptionist lady for many great conversations. The suite was beautiful and spacious, even has a kitchen. It was nice to have breakfast in the room. You can choose to have brekkie by the pool, in the lobby area or in your room. They even made sure to offer us glutenfree breakfast. Pool is quite small but in a nice area with sauna and steamroom which you can turn on yourself. Shower / toilet have been built against a huge rock, which makes the area quite unique. The spa upstairs is great, the massage therapists are very good, and one spa treatment is included in the room price. With the free shuttle bus you can go anywhere in the town. Motorbike can be parked in the parking hall. Whoever built the Wind hotels concept knows a lot about excellent customer service and customer retention. We definitely want to go back and can highly recommend this hotel to everyone! It was a slight pity that rooftop area was not open.####[['The location is nice along a relatively quiet street and away from Back Beach noise .

138323,absolutely gorgeous, even better in real life - felt like a boutique-y four seasons. the bar on the top floor was beautiful and all of the food at the restaurant fantastic. whoever designed or built the hotel is clearly a world traveler with impeccable taste. gym was really nice too (did not take advantage of the spa) service was great except at the pool - constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the (quite large) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don’t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down. It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting, you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes. Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment, you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot (or didn’t understand because of language barrier?). Then by then the food is cold. Frequently saw 2-3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention. Also, the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours (this was a Monday afternoon) stirring up lots of insects. Why isn’t this done early morning or evening when there are less people trying to enjoy the pool? If it weren’t for the pool experience being unpleasant, I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation. Because of this, I don’t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn’t enjoyable to sit by the pool. But we still would come back for the rooms, gym and food.####[['absolutely gorgeous , even better in real life', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' all of the food at the restaurant fantastic', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['the bar on the top floor was beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['felt like a boutique - y four seasons', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['gym was really nice too', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['service was great except at the pool', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the ( quite large ) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don ’ t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting , you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment , you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Then by then the food is cold', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Frequently saw 2 - 3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['stirring up lots of insects', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['I don ’ t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn ’ t enjoyable to sit by the pool', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['But we still would come back for the rooms , gym and food', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['If it weren ’ t for the pool experience being unpleasant , I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation', 'Branding', 'Neutral']]

139121,This is a gem of a Homestay. It is perfect as it’s tucked away so peaceful from the main road, but close enough to walk. The included breakfast was fantastic and varied. My room was large and spotless with a stunning view and very comfy pillows. The room and stay was quiet which is perfect for me as a late sleeper. Ha in particular, the hostess, is a diamond woman who is so helpful and kind. The hosts were so kind and accommodating - emailing me at 7pm to check my check in time and allowing me a late check in. I don’t recommend you do this (and it’s difficult to do) but I fell in a rice paddy and they cleaned me, my clothes and made me a late dinner. It is one of the best stays I’ve ever had.

140115,the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish, the owner and the staff generally polite, friendly and helpful. i was offered free tea during check-in and check-out. good communication via whatsapp, the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in. on arrival my scooter was brought to a safe place and they also took care of my keys and gear. Unfortunately there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds. On arrival I was warned of the nocturnal noise from the street - to be fair, before paying. However, the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs, even the mattress vibrated (and that was on the 4th floor, not directly at the street and on a tuesday) - not the hotels fault, but guests should be aware of this. After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff, they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel (30k) saying it couldn't be reused anymore (!). after i asked if it's possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away, they wanted to bill me for 200k.

139460,Our experience at Zizi homestay in Sapa was a spiritual journey that allowed us to witness the sacred rituals and beliefs of the Hmong community. The lodge, surrounded by towering peaks, provided a breathtaking setting for our trek. The guided trek led us through sacred sites, ancient temples, and shared moments of spiritual reflection. Each step felt like a step towards embracing the sacred wisdom of Hmong culture. The reverent hosts guided us through traditional ceremonies, offering us insight into their spiritual practices. Back at the lodge, we were treated to a sacred ritual, witnessing the deep reverence the Hmong have for their ancestors and nature. As the sun set, we gathered for a contemplative meditation session, enveloped in the profound tranquility of the mountains. While our overall experience was fantastic, some guests noticed occasional water supply disruptions, which added to the rustic charm but might cause minor inconveniences. However, it became an opportunity to appreciate the sacred connection the lodge has with nature and the mountains.

1999,A wonderful and peaceful oasis in the busy area of Cai Be. As we know the only place right on the river. We had a river view bungalow and it was really fantastic to watch all the life floating on the water. Staff and restaurant are not very professional due to lack of English language.

140057,Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely, airy, clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea. The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city, particularly at night. The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter's birthday (highly recommend for a fun afternoon/evening) Breakfast is great in the hotel, but there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about. Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night. Be prepared though as it was very busy on all the surrounding streets, so if you don't like crowds, you'll have to see the fire-breathing from a distance !! This is isn't a criticism of the hotel, but be aware there is a lot of development going on in Da Nang and lots of construction site. On one of the days there was a lot of drilling and banging coming from a nearby site and there is a stage on the beach directly below the hotel that plays loud music most night until 11pm. Also be prepared for noise form the street outside (tooting of horns, etc) and also the fact the beach is packed at 5. 30am with people watching the sunrise. None of these things can be controlled by the hotel though and they didn't detract from our stay. In short, if you want peace and quiet Da Nang is probably not the place for you....####[['Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely , airy , clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city , particularly at night', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter \' s birthday ', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast is great in the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

139855,Good location around 5 minutes from the beach. The rooftop pool had a good view across the city. The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con, comfy bed, fridge, toiletries. The hotel was very noisy. We had a large family who used the hallway and lift as a playground, with the children screaming and crying while the parents shouted up and down the hallway from 5. 30am until midnight each day. We told reception who didn't care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy. There are alarms on the hotel bedroom doors as they are awkward to close, the alarms are good for safety however the other rooms would leave their doors open with the alarms beeping from early until late which again kept us awake. The hotel is not 4*, more 2 or 3*, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating. The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily. The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up. We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym, just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment, no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill. There are lots of hotels in the area - I wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price.####[['Good location around 5 minutes from the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The rooftop pool had a good view across the city .', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con , comfy bed , fridge , toiletries', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The hotel was very noisy', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['We told reception who didn \' t care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The hotel is not 4 *, more 2 or 3 *, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym , just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment , no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['I wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price', 'Branding', 'Negative']]

Breakfast was good with a good buffet selection and additional items such as omlettes and pancakes for ordering. The location despite being great is right at the end of the night market which means on a Friday night it is incredibly noisy. The hotel is also split into two so we went to the wrong hotel first - but they are only about 20 metres apart so not a big issues though we also had to go to the other hotel for breakfast, We were on the 7th floor and had to take an incredibly slow lift to the 6th floor and then stairs to the 7th - worth considering if you have mobility issues. Note as well we were upgraded to a room with a balcony and view but unfortunately the room was like a goldfish bowl with windows all around and curtains that didn't cover the windows well meaning a lot of bright light came in from the streetlights and night market.####[['Very friendly staff in a incredibly', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' located hotel in the heart of the Old Quarter', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' Breakfast was good with a good buffet selection and additional items such as omlettes and pancakes for ordering', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The location despite being great is right at the end of the night market', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' on a Friday night it is incredibly noisy .', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['The hotel is also split into two so we went to the wrong hotel first - but they are only about 20 metres apart so not a big issues though we also had to go to the other hotel for breakfast , We were on the 7th floor and had to take an incredibly slow lift to the 6th floor and then stairs to the 7th', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], [' worth considering if you have mobility issues', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], [' Note as well we were upgraded to a room with a balcony and view', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' windows all around and curtains that didn \' t cover the windows well', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['meaning a lot of bright light came in from the streetlights and night market', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

194,Staff was nice REALLY DIRTY, with many traces from other customers. The room was very small (which is ok in another context) but it didnt even have a proper window. The only window was facing a wall, so it was claustrophobic. They seem to have 2 types of rooms, the ones from the outside bulding, which I guess are the ones showing in booking, and the ones from the back building. Our room had absolutely nothing to do with the pictures! Ask them to show you the room at least before paying. It was DISGUSTING staying at this place, such an overpiced hotel! Dont waste your money here!The good rating in Booking is probably due to the staff actively asking you to put them a review of 10 when you leave…The only positive thing is the staff is helpful, even though many of them dont speak english####[['Staff was nice', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['REALLY DIRTY , with many traces from other customers', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The room was very small', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' it didnt even have a proper window', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The only window was facing a wall , so it was claustrophobic', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['It was DISGUSTING staying at this place , such an overpiced hotel', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['Dont waste your money here', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['The only positive thing is the staff is helpful , even though many of them dont speak english', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Our room had absolutely nothing to do with the pictures', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Ask them to show you the room at least before paying', 'Experience', 'Negative']]
139164,The room was fine. Nothing overwhelming. Small bathroom incl. a shower (not seperated) underneath the starecase. So definitely nothing for tall people. The homestay is very close to the beach and has a very nice design as advertised in the pictures although a little worn down in the room itself. In my case I didn't have a window - only one to the hall way. The owner is not living at the same place so I had to wait to get instructions about the key code etc. However, that also made it very easy to check-in and out. Overall, good value for your money and would stay another time, maybe in a bigger room (that was sold out at that time) There were quite a lot of (old) spider webs in my rooms. Couldn't harm to get rid of them.

139569,We arrived late to this charming hotel, check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade. Our room was well appointed, just as pictured in the photos with a very comfortable bed. In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields. Both the ladies at reception, Xí and Vân, took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind. From helping us book taxis, tours (we booked Golden Bridge), laundry services, massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning, they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional. They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight! This hotel is located halfway between An Bang Beach and Hoi An Old Town, in a peaceful, tranquil rural setting. It’s ideally situated for day trips like basket boat tours and even Tra Que Culinary Village. We loved being able to see the farmers work the land in this authentic setting and walking to nearby little cafés. We used the free bicycles to explore the area a few times, which was very pleasant. It would be a quick 10-15 minute bike ride into town. The pool was a little too cold for us during our one week stay in February, but it was still lovely to sit around on the comfy loungers and listen to the trickling water, like a little oasis. The gentleman who works on the grounds doesn’t speak English, but he works very hard to maintain the property, is the hotel’s security, gardener and I’m sure whatever else needs doing. Our hats off to him! We Canadians highly recommend this little gem of a hotel just outside the busy area. We’d like to thank the staff at Maison Fleur Hoi An for a wonderful stay! Occasionally we had to be patient to get a Grab taxi to come and pick us up at the property as it's a little out of the way. But this is also part of why we liked the hotel.####[['check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Our room was well appointed', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' just as pictured in the photos', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Both the ladies at reception , Xí and Vân , took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['From helping us book taxis , tours ( we booked Golden Bridge ), laundry services , massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning , they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight !

At first I had booked another hotel in Phu Quoc but after reading the reviews, I canceled and booked Andochine instead. It was more $$$ but well worth it. It was a “mini vacation” within my tiring vacation. The villa had a private pool right on the beachfront. The beach was beautiful but the waves were too strong - so it was dangerous to swim. Good thing we had the private pool all to ourselves. My family really enjoyed the much needed relaxation. The bedrooms and bathrooms were very very clean. The beds were very comfortable.

1580,The room was comfortable and clean, and the pool was very nice (apart from the rubbish at the bottom). It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi’s are available to get into town. The cleaning staff were very friendly. The staff weren’t helpful - there is a clear lack of management. The pool bar wait times are ridiculous, 1. 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water, 1. 5 for food as well. On our first 2 days the wait wasn’t as bad but there was only one person, the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long. The food and drink is also very overpriced (western prices) and very average. The laundry service is ridiculously expensive, we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear! There is no local advice available from the staff. We weren’t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren’t offered the welcome drink they advertise. Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment. The breakfast is constantly running out, and even if all the food and drink is available, there are no cups or plates to use! The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover, there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it. Overall, this is a 3 star experience, but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it’s a good option.####[['The room was comfortable and clean , and the pool was very nice ', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi ’ s are available to get into town', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The cleaning staff were very friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The staff weren ’ t helpful - there is a clear lack of management', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The pool bar wait times are ridiculous', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['1 . 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water , 1 . 5 for food as well', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['On our first 2 days the wait wasn ’ t as bad but there was only one person , the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long', 'Service', 'Negative'], [' The laundry service is ridiculously expensive , we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The food and drink is also very overpriced', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['and very average', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['There is no local advice available from the staff', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['We weren ’ t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren ’ t offered the welcome drink they advertise', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The breakfast is constantly running out , and even if all the food and drink is available , there are no cups or plates to use', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover , there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['this is a 3 star experience , but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it ’ s a good option', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

In terms of cleanliness, room size and amenities as well I'd rate the hotel excellent. The hotel staff is extremely courteous and friendly. A special mention to the receptionist 'Nga'' she is very humble and ensures the guests have a very good experience. She understands and speaks English which makes it easier to communicate and ask for any information as a tourist, she goes out of her way to help you out. The hotel has a small restaurant and staff attending to your food needs and making the environment very homely. Their services are excellent, we had a small glitch with the hot water in our room, when we raised the concern, it was immediately resolved. Overall we had a very good experience and would strongly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a pleasant stay at hoi an Nothing####[['We had a great and extremely comfortable stay at this hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['First of all the hotel is just at a 10 mins walkable distance from old town , lantern lake , japanese bridge ', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['s it a perfect location', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['In terms of cleanliness , room size and amenities as well I \' d rate the hotel excellent', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The hotel staff is extremely courteous and friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['she is very humble and ensures the guests have a very good experience', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['She understands and speaks English which makes it easier to communicate and ask for any information as a tourist , she goes out of her way to help you out', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The hotel has a small restaurant', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], [' staff attending to your food needs and making the environment very homely', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Their services are excellent', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['we raised the concern , it was immediately resolved', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['we had a small glitch with the hot water in our room', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['Overall we had a very good experience', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['would strongly recommend the hotel to anyone looking for a pleasant stay at hoi an', 'Loyalty', 'Positive']]

138960,The pool was a god send as we had moved from another hotel in the city as it did not have a pool. Also the close proximity to the airport and free shuttle service for our departure was excellent. The pool area had no staff in attendance through out the day and I had to go down to the lobby to ask for towels to be sent up. Also there was no option to order meals/drinks at lunch time at the pool; as the staff did not start until 4pm. Again I went down to the restaurant in the lobby to ask about getting a meal & drinks sent up to the pool. I was told the only way we could do this was to order room service and take it up to the pool. So we had to return to our room, order our meal then return to the pool. In that time our towels had been removed so had to go get more towels. All this inconvenience could have been fix with either one staff member in attendance at the pool during the day or a telephone at the pool bar with instructions to call & order meals/drinks over the phone. Safety around the pool should also be consider, no staff means anything could happens up on the roof... even if there is CCTV!####[['the close proximity to the airport', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['free shuttle service for our departure was excellent', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The pool area had no staff in attendance through out the day and I had to go down to the lobby to ask for towels to be sent up', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['there was no option to order meals / drinks at lunch time at the pool ; as the staff did not start until 4pm .

139250,The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture. There were ample electrical socketss. The bathroom and plumbing was quite good. The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy. There was plenty of parking near the gate. There was easy access to a lovely clean beach, direct from the resort. There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures. it was surrounded by trees giving ample shade to the loungers. The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view. There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure, Napoli being the best. We have used this one many times in the past. There are some small local shops ( kiosks) for basic needs. The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer. Not much! Like a lot of the resorts here, they suffer from a lack of customers during covid so have an air of being a bit run-down. However the faults were minor and did not detract from our stay. The restaurant only had a partial service due to lack of customers. There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning, when the resort filled up for the weekend. At other times there was a limited menu. There wasn't anywhere to hang wet clothes after, say, a swim and nothing to sit on outside.####[['The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There were ample electrical socketss', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The bathroom and plumbing was quite good', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There was plenty of parking near the gate', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There was easy access to a lovely clean beach , direct from the resort', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure , Napoli being the best', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There are some small local shops ( kiosks ) for basic needs', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning , when the resort filled up for the weekend', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['At other times there was a limited menu', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['There wasn \' t anywhere to hang wet clothes after , say , a swim and nothing to sit on outside', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

1135,The view from the room My stay was a marathon of mistakes.

Then I want to go to the pool, so I leave my room - but oh the keyroom reader on my door doesn’t work - turns out battery ran out! So I go to the lobby and ask the lobby guy to fix it. He promises to come back in a moment to do so, so I wait for him in my room. Doesnt show up. Had to go ask for it AGAIN the next day for this guy to do his work (of course no one at the reception figured that it would perhaps be a good idea to call me and let me know he wont show up using the room phone next to bed) And then to top it off, its about 3:10 am in the middle of the night and now the hotel room telephone built in next to my bed rings. I pick it up. Nothing. Well, thanks for giving me a call in the middle of the night smart person at the reception So yeah it wasnt a good stay.

609,rien My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare. From the outset, the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous. The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic English. In a highly unprofessional move, he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking. com platform, promising “better apartments, better views, and more check-in options.” He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times! And after reading reviews from previous guests, I discovered that those who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn’t get any of the promised benefits. The deceit didn’t stop there. On the check-in day, the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower. This was a complete bait and switch, and it left us feeling utterly duped. To add insult to injury, the apartment itself was a disaster. The furniture was old, worn, and filthy, and the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online. It was smaller, older, and lacked any charm or modern decoration. The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding. As if that weren’t enough, the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay. We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water. It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard. In short, our stay at Landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism. I urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere. It’s simply not worth the stress, frustration, and betrayal.####[['My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic Englis', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['In a highly unprofessional move , he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking . com platform , promising “ better apartments , better views , and more check - in options', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times !', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn ’ t get any of the promised benefits', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The deceit didn ’ t stop there', 'Service', 'Negative'], [' the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['This was a complete bait and switch', 'Service', 'Negative'], [' it left us feeling utterly duped', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' the apartment itself was a disaster', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The furniture was old , worn , and filthy', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['It was smaller , older , and lacked any charm or modern decoration .', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' our stay at Landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['I urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], [' It ’ s simply not worth the stress , frustration , and betrayal', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

274,We stayed in one of the pool villas and it was amazing! It was like a spacious 1 bedroom apartment. The perfect way to end our 4 week stay in Vietnam. The buffet breakfast which was included in the price was without doubt the best we had, so much on offer. The pool was great. And the restaurant Blu Lobster is amazing, we ate there twice. Make sure you watch the sunrise as well, stunning. One small complaint, they were unable to give us a complimentary 2pm checkout, so we booked the hotel shuttle to take us to the airport at 1 for a 3. 45 flight. The man then told us we dont need that much time to be at the airport. And tried pushing us back to 2. We compromised for 1. 45. But had to sit in the lobby bored out of our minds, at least at the airport there are things to look at and we could have got lunch. And I like to mot be rushed at the airport Always go with what you want.

They took the dirty towels away without replacing new ones. I had to constantly ask house keeping to replace our towels. The room was dusty and there were lots of small insects in the room. No counter space in the bathroom to leave toiletries. Limited hanging space/hooks to hang wet towels. Very poor for a family room. Breakfast buffet was basic, bar staff were friendly, but had no idea how to make basic cocktails even though they were on the drinks menu.####[['Location was convenient', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' staff were really helpful and friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The room was extremely dark as our window looked out onto a wall and a roof top with broken air conditioner units on', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' house keeping did not replace or restock shower gel , towels or bathroom mats during out 3 night stay', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['They took the dirty towels away without replacing new ones', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['I had to constantly ask house keeping to replace our towels', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['The room was dusty and there were lots of small insects in the room', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' No counter space in the bathroom to leave toiletries', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Limited hanging space / hooks to hang wet towels', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Breakfast buffet was basic', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['bar staff were friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['but had no idea how to make basic cocktails even though they were on the drinks menu', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Very poor for a family room', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

The staff from the owner came without notice, ring the bell and ask to pay the bill. She admitted her mistake of not providing a double bed and reduced the payment. regardless I couldn’t sleep. This room includes breakfast but be aware that it’s not hotel breakfast!!!! They take you to a local eatery for breakfast. The owner poorly communicates so the restaurant staff asked me to pay for the meal.

1102,New hotel, ok location Quite simply, the hotel lied...about many things. Lie 1) I booked this hotel for my wife's birthday as it has a spa centre, as per the info on their website. There is NO operating spa centre. When I asked about this I was told it was still under construction and that if I wanted to book a spa we can walk around the corner. Lie 2) I'm training for a triathlon so when I saw that the fitness centre is open 24 hours, I thought great! The gym closes at 7pm and is NOT 24 hours. Also, the treadmills don't work. The belt stalls with each step so you can't even walk let alone run. And there are no sanitizing wipes, towels, bins or even access to water. Lie 3) The sunset bar looked great on their website, especially with the snacks and "signature cocktails" noted. There are NO cocktails and no snacks. And what the heck is the point of a pool and bar that closes at 7pm? I kept being told, not enough staff. Lie 4) The restaurant '12 Kitchen' is listed on their website as serving a buffet breakfast and dinner. There is NO dinner served and the breakfast closes at 9:30am. Lie 5) The hotel is listed on booking. com as 5 stars?! I'm not sure on which planet they got this rating but it is a 3 star at best. Definitely not an international standard 5 star. There is also, NO room service and nothing in the mini bar in the rooms. The rooms are ok, but...Upon arrival, the top shelves in the wardrobes were very dusty and we had to wipe them down before using them. The rooms were relatively clean but definitely not to a high standard. Housekeeping staff didn't even wash the glasses on a number of occasions. There is only a kettle with a couple of sachets of coffee issued. The toilets....oh the toilets...if you plan on using anything more than 3 individual squares of toilet paper, be prepared for a blocked toilet.

421,Incredibly comfortable bed. Great location. Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements. Preface: Their claim is "Beyond Perfection" and it is marketed as a "Luxury Boutique" 5 star hotel. While beautifully designed, many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience (function of light switches, relative position of shower and towel for maximum water coverage of said towels, maintenance work during check-out hours) and some elements already are showing wear and tear. For a 5 star hotel, the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training, with very odd formalities that were unnecessary, poorly executed, or just awkward.
