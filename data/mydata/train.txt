1702,There was a cafe right outside the hotel that was affordably priced and i like how the hotel was tucked into a quiet alley. Japantown isn't super close to everything in downtown Saigon but to many places just a 15 min walk away. The staff were TOP tier and were so friendly even late at night. They were helpful and so kind. Breakfast buffet was decent, I ate there everyday. Mini stop on the top of the alley and many places to eat nearby. Laundry service is WAY too expensive. I would suggest finding on your own and them having it delivered (I did this). I find the layout of the room a bit odd. Had the deluxe but felt the shower and toilet was too exposed for the room and the bum spray was a little bit too harsh to use easily. Only one elevator but it's not too bad to leave easily. But really no complaints I enjoyed my week here! ####[['There was a cafe right outside the hotel that was affordably priced and i like how the hotel was tucked into a quiet alley', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["Japantown isn ' t super close to everything in downtown Saigon but to many places just a 15 min walk away", 'Amenity', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The staff were TOP tier and were so friendly even late at night', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They were helpful and so kind', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast buffet was decent , I ate there everyday', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Mini stop on the top of the alley and many places to eat nearby', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Laundry service is WAY too expensive', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I find the layout of the room a bit odd', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Had the deluxe but felt the shower and toilet was too exposed for the room and the bum spray was a little bit too harsh to use easily', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["Only one elevator but it ' s not too bad to leave easily", 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['no complaints I enjoyed my week here', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I would suggest finding on your own and them having it delivered', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]
138922,Lily is the most attentive host you could ask for in a homestay. From the time that we arrived at the railway station, where she and her brother personally came to collect us, we were given her full attention whenever we required it. The room we stayed in, with a balcony, was spacious, modern and very clean; the best accommodation we've had in Vietnam, at a very reasonable rate. Bicycles were complimentary. We spent two days comfortably cycling around the area, including Mua Cave and Trang An. Lily offers discounted prices on spa treatments. There are some wonderful options for eating, drinking coffee and enjoying a beer all within walking distance.

441,Well worth the price! Convenient location right by the airport. Premium looking finishes in the interior of the room and the hotel in general. Clean and fresh sheets everyday care of the excellent housekeeping. Great pool area and good view of the sunset from higher levels. Service and care from the front desk staff is EXCEPTIONAL, in addition to the good level of english they have. They are quick to respond to any concerns and queries guests have. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel as one of the budget-friendly options in the island. They lock the front doors at night but the staff are easily contactable to open the door even at early hours of the morning. Maybe the hotel could switch to a passcode/keycard system for this as not to disturb the staff too much?Food could also be a bit better but this is not too much of a drawback for the value you are getting from your stay. The location is also not the best as there is nothing too noteworthy in the immediate area, but Grab is easily accessible to downtown 10 minutes away.

1135,The view from the room My stay was a marathon of mistakes. First the girl at the lobby takes out my debit card from the reader too fast so the transaction fails (but I still get charged) - so I have to pay second time and she requests the bank to give me a refund (WHICH STILL ISNT PROCESSED AFTER 2 WEEKS). Then I want to go to the pool, so I leave my room - but oh the keyroom reader on my door doesn’t work - turns out battery ran out! So I go to the lobby and ask the lobby guy to fix it. He promises to come back in a moment to do so, so I wait for him in my room. Doesnt show up. Had to go ask for it AGAIN the next day for this guy to do his work (of course no one at the reception figured that it would perhaps be a good idea to call me and let me know he wont show up using the room phone next to bed) And then to top it off, its about 3:10 am in the middle of the night and now the hotel room telephone built in next to my bed rings. I pick it up. Nothing. Well, thanks for giving me a call in the middle of the night smart person at the reception So yeah it wasnt a good stay.

139199,Exceptional location! Surrounded by mountains and with a lake in front, away from the chaos of city, serene and peaceful. The property is nestled within a well maintained garden, has swings and a lounging/dining area. the room was spacious, clean with decently done decor, a large bathroom and deck. I loved the view from the room- of the sun coming up from behind the mountain and shining on the lake, filling the room with sunlight. Hai - the host is quite a barista and brews very good Italian coffee. The family dog Gung - is very friendly and welcoming. The hosts were very welcoming and generous - even offering to help with our laundry. I would without a doubt recommend this place to stay. Note: The location is ~ 2 kms from city centre and dining options. So you will need a motorbike/cycle to get there. The property will be able to help with those options.

Also the close proximity to the airport and free shuttle service for our departure was excellent. The pool area had no staff in attendance through out the day and I had to go down to the lobby to ask for towels to be sent up. Also there was no option to order meals/drinks at lunch time at the pool; as the staff did not start until 4pm. Again I went down to the restaurant in the lobby to ask about getting a meal & drinks sent up to the pool. I was told the only way we could do this was to order room service and take it up to the pool. So we had to return to our room, order our meal then return to the pool. In that time our towels had been removed so had to go get more towels. All this inconvenience could have been fix with either one staff member in attendance at the pool during the day or a telephone at the pool bar with instructions to call & order meals/drinks over the phone.

Surelee, the owner has to change a little bit her attitude. I understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude. Her property, which she named a "homestay", doesn't quite reflect what a homestay should be, since, being Italians and having Italian dishes on the menu, we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused. Also, in my opinion she push to much the customers to purchase her trekking tour which are very expensive compared to the ones found walking by the villages.

In The evening they have a band playing in the sky bar which is nice and jolly. The food choice at the rooftop pool and bar area is very disappointing and it’s expensive. However I would recommend the steakhouse. The service is pretty slow at reception I waited seven hours for them to fix my phone in my room. Had to call off my mobile phone several times to remind them and the air con wasn’t working and as no one turned up I ended up having to go down stairs in my pjs to ask for someone to come up. I stayed there this time last year and the service was much better so it’s definitely gone downhill. I spoke to the manager about it and they did let me extend my checkout time for free as compensation. However I did feel like it was a very long time to wait and especially because I was trying to get to sleep it was very hot. ####[['Facilities are very good', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The swimming pool is on the rooftop and an infinity pool and it ’ s stunning especially when the Sun is shining you can just spend the day there topping up your tan and drinking cocktails', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['In The evening they have a band playing in the sky bar which is nice and jolly', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The food choice at the rooftop pool and bar area is very disappointing and it ’ s expensive', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The service is pretty slow at reception I waited seven hours for them to fix my phone in my room', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Had to call off my mobile phone several times to remind them and the air con wasn ’ t working and as no one turned up I ended up having to go down stairs in my pjs to ask for someone to come up', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

138437,This was our best accomodation in Vietnam. There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses. There are small pools with fish and water flowers, it is like in a fairy-tale. I really recommend the place. Our bathroom was in the back of the house, outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle. Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also. We arrived in february and the weather was perfect. Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area. This is perfect for nature lovers. The room itself was clean and spacious. Clean towels and linen. The young ladies at the reception are welkoming and very helpful with everything you need. They organised transportation, help with motorcicle or motorbike rental, offer info and help with everything. They are very kind. They organised us the boat tour to floating market and arranged us the transportation to their places and then to the airport in Can Tho based on our group needs. Excellent comunication with them. The place is in the rural area near Can Tho so it is interesting to explore the villages by bicicle and see how people live, make an idea of how the life in around water canals. There is a local-style minimarket at walking distance from the accomodation. If you dont ride bicicle or motorbike the area might look a bit remote. We found no other place to eat at walking distance but we reached a small town at 6 km of bicicle ride with the help of google maps where you can find everything. We bought some exotic interesting fruits there in the fruit market and brought them at the accomodation and enjoyed them in the eating area. The boat tour on the canals and at the floating market revealed a lot of pollution. Plastic waste floating everywhere. It is very sad to see that. Otherwise it is interesting to see the trade at the floating market. ####[['This was our best accomodation in Vietnam', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There are small pools with fish and water flowers , it is like in a fairy - tale', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I really recommend the place', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our bathroom was in the back of the house , outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area .

The beach view rooms come with one little drawback: music playing through the night on the beach audible even on the higher floors with windows closed. For guests with light sleep, city view might be a good consideration (not a bad view anyhow - see photo). Closing time of the rooftop bar at 22:00 is something guests have to count with.

579,All the staff were lovely. In particular Thuy and Ahn. We were made to feel like family and they went out of their way to make our stay more enjoyable. The hotel owner was also lovely, she even gifted us on departure, which is a beautiful and very appreciated gesture .The team of staff are very small and we’re mostly all lovely. The rooms were beautiful and way above the standard of what we paid. Breakfast was good there were both western and plenty of Vietnamese options, but the fruit selection in the morning was always fresh and plentiful. The staff always ask if you want anything special cooked for breakfast and went out of their way to order us yummy pho for breakfast (they don’t usually have this on the menu. The pool is actually bigger than what we expected and was made great use of during the hot Hoi An summer heat . Overall excellent value for money There wasn’t a lot to fault about this hotel. If I have to be picky, it was probably further away from market then we imagined. But it was extremely hot when we were there,and we aren’t game enough for motorcycles, so it may have felt further away then it was . Vihn (I think that’s his name , the only male front concierge) can work on his customer service skills.

140057,Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely, airy, clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea. The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city, particularly at night. The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter's birthday (highly recommend for a fun afternoon/evening) Breakfast is great in the hotel, but there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about. Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night. Be prepared though as it was very busy on all the surrounding streets, so if you don't like crowds, you'll have to see the fire-breathing from a distance !! This is isn't a criticism of the hotel, but be aware there is a lot of development going on in Da Nang and lots of construction site. On one of the days there was a lot of drilling and banging coming from a nearby site and there is a stage on the beach directly below the hotel that plays loud music most night until 11pm. Also be prepared for noise form the street outside (tooting of horns, etc) and also the fact the beach is packed at 5. 30am with people watching the sunrise. None of these things can be controlled by the hotel though and they didn't detract from our stay. In short, if you want peace and quiet Da Nang is probably not the place for you.... ####[['Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely , airy , clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city , particularly at night', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter ' s birthday", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast is great in the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]
139359,The room is really large, new and clean. Same for bathroom. The place is very quite. The owner is very kind, she was very helpful to arrange all the transportations, from Halong Bay to Tam Coc, and from Tam Coc to Hanoi, as well as arranging for our tour in the area. Good choices for the breakfast. Nothing really to complain. There are some restructuring works in progress in nearby resorts, but not affecting the stay. Just the road to reach the place around the lake is a bit bumpy because of these works, however the other side of road around the lake is ok, so no issue to walk from the resort to the town. ####[['The room is really large , new and clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The place is very quite', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The owner is very kind , she was very helpful to arrange all the transportations', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Good choices for the breakfast', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL']]
1887,Breakfast was not included on our stay which we knew when booking. There is a beautiful coffee shop right across the street for breakfast. The staff were wonderful, Hang and Tin especially and the others whose names we don't know. If you want to avoid being ripped off by local taxis, ask the staff to arrange transport. Through them it was nearly a quarter of the price! Remember it is a budget priced hotel in a great location so keep that in mind if you book. Our bathroom had been remodelled which was nice. Circle K almost next door. Fridge on all the time. Aircon good.

Bottom line: We had a great time and would definitely recommend staying here, just a little bit outside touristy old town but very easy to reach. And within a 15 minute bike ride to the beach.

818,It is quite a modern hostel with all facilities. In fact it looks like a good hotel. There is plenty of space in the dorms, and in the restaurant area near reception. The beds are large and comfortable. In fact the beds are like a capsule, so once you close the curtain, there is full privacy. The bathrooms are sufficient and well equipped. They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop. I rented motorbike from here. They have really new and good quality bikes. The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house. They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat, cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike. The extra luggage can also be stored for free. They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop. The staff at the reception speaks and understands English. While the facilities are top notch, their maintenance is not upto the mark. People wear shoes in the dorms, there is nobody responsible for the lockers. There are lockers but the key is not available. I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people. They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests. The dorms are air conditioned, but since the beds are capsule type, there is no ventilation inside the cubicle.

1543,Very friendly staff in a incredibly located hotel in the heart of the Old Quarter. Breakfast was good with a good buffet selection and additional items such as omlettes and pancakes for ordering. The location despite being great is right at the end of the night market which means on a Friday night it is incredibly noisy. The hotel is also split into two so we went to the wrong hotel first - but they are only about 20 metres apart so not a big issues though we also had to go to the other hotel for breakfast, We were on the 7th floor and had to take an incredibly slow lift to the 6th floor and then stairs to the 7th - worth considering if you have mobility issues. Note as well we were upgraded to a room with a balcony and view but unfortunately the room was like a goldfish bowl with windows all around and curtains that didn't cover the windows well meaning a lot of bright light came in from the streetlights and night market. ####[['Very friendly staff in a incredibly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['located hotel in the heart of the Old Quarter', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast was good with a good buffet selection and additional items such as omlettes and pancakes for ordering', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The location despite being great is right at the end of the night market', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['on a Friday night it is incredibly noisy .', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The hotel is also split into two so we went to the wrong hotel first - but they are only about 20 metres apart so not a big issues though we also had to go to the other hotel for breakfast , We were on the 7th floor and had to take an incredibly slow lift to the 6th floor and then stairs to the 7th', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['worth considering if you have mobility issues', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Note as well we were upgraded to a room with a balcony and view', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["windows all around and curtains that didn ' t cover the windows well", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['meaning a lot of bright light came in from the streetlights and night market', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

138765,The resort was phenomenal!!! This was my first time visiting Vietnam with my family and after traveling from north to south, we were exhausted. At first I had booked another hotel in Phu Quoc but after reading the reviews, I canceled and booked Andochine instead. It was more $$$ but well worth it. It was a “mini vacation” within my tiring vacation. The villa had a private pool right on the beachfront. The beach was beautiful but the waves were too strong - so it was dangerous to swim. Good thing we had the private pool all to ourselves. My family really enjoyed the much needed relaxation. The bedrooms and bathrooms were very very clean. The beds were very comfortable. The basement also had a billiard room and a poker room.

I am glad to say that Sun river staff changed my attitude towards Vietnam and I am so glad I came back and I now have happy memories of this country. They also offered us free breakfast for our entire stay in celebration of reopening after covid. The rooms were squeaky clean and well equipped.

139420,The cruise was efficient with nearly everything run on time. The food was of a good standard - with all the meals provided there is very little to worry about. You won’t go hungry either - plenty on offer at all times. The staff were friendly and happy to help throughout our stay. This is true of the guide we had on our second day (of three). We were the only guests to stay on for 2 nights (although note there is always a combination of single and 2 night guests) so our second day was just us - perfect! We had arranged transfers with La Regina and both arrived on time and took us where we needed to go. The room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning (very necessary for Westerners visiting Vietnam in July!), lovely bed and private balcony. All the trips had what we needed to participate too. This is not a romantic or quiet cruise; if you want that, I’d look somewhere else. The boat was full when we went and most of the other guests were quiet loud Vietnamese on holiday (it may differ at other times of the year). Personally, we don’t like timetables / schedules so didn’t warm to the frequent announcements but we did get all the activities we were promised. We didn’t get the “welcome drinks” mentioned in the original information but a minor thing. ####[['everything run on time', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The food was of a good standard - with all the meals provided there is very little to worry about', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The staff were friendly and happy to help throughout our stay', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We had arranged transfers with La Regina and both arrived on time and took us where we needed to go', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['lovely bed and private balcony', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We didn ’ t get the “ welcome drinks ” mentioned in the original information', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

139620,The location is central, there is a supermarket nearby, nice Banh-Mi-Stands around the corner and a coffee shop closeby (E-Coffee). There were toilet amenities (soap, TP, toothbrush). The AC was working and quiet. We booked this hotel. We arrived after a long journey, and a sign was saying: we send you a message with all booking infos to self check-in. Said message never arrived. I contacted the responsible, who was quick to answer: we have issues with the climate control we have to rebook you to another location. That's how we got to Supertramp. Funny thing: it happened to another lady while we were there and she told us they rebooked her because the other one was full. This hotel looks way nicer than the other - which is why we think it's a scam. Now, reading other reviews, I realized it happened before. Coming to Supertramp:It's a construction site!At first we got offered a room with no window, which was not what we booked. They showed us another room, which we took. The room contained a kitchen and a washing-maschine (both not working) and a bed. The room was so tiny that we couldn't put our bags on the ground. Why do you put a not functioning kitchen+machine if there is no space already?!The cupboards were moist, some dirty towels were roting in them. The room was dirty. I made the mistake of looking behind the bed and in the cupboard - so much dirt, dust and spiderwebs. The walls are quite thin and not soundproof, so we heard everything (from neighbors to elevator and construction work).We wanted to pay online, but they didn't accept it: only cash. As we just arrived, we didn't have VND yet and explained that we would contact them as soon as we did and pay the bill. We stayed 3 days. Within the first day we got contacted 3 times to ask for the money (even though we previously made an agreement). In the end we got woken up by a random lady the next morning at 8a. m (she wouldn't stop knocking, spoke no English, just said "money,money". Nobody told us she would come and wake us up.

The owners of the hotel, a sweet pair of aunty and uncle, tried to make up for it by packing a small picnic for our Mua Cave visit.

The location outside of Sapa is much nicer than staying at a hotel in downtown Sapa, which is extremely touristy and busy. Overall I'd book this hotel again! The taxi system between Sapa and the hotel was a bit time-consuming and expensive (200k VND each way), the driver is sometimes busy with other passengers, so it can take 20+ minutes until you're picked up.

36,Nam House is a ray of tranquillity only 800m from the centre of the small town but nowhere near the backpacker hostel and hassle. The house is simply but beautifully designed, all the facilities you need are there and nothing you do not. The small touches of the herbal foot bath and the local grown tea are excellent. I did not meet Ha as she was out doing other business but her sister Moon was excellent and helped me with everything including a late night move to the train station.

I loved the spa and foodies should try the restaurants and cafes, one is Michelin rated. the Chinese restaurant is famous for its dim sims and I loved their red rice rolls. I had so much fun there I barely left the hotel. This place makes other 5 star places look like 2 star. I had a room on 36 level so if you don’t like heights let them know when you book. the price is reasonable for what they offer.

139280,We like the location of this hotel. It is very close to the center but not noisy. The staffs are friendly and helpful and they arrange activities like basket boat tour and cooking lessons. If you are staying in this hotel, I highly recommend booking the combined basket boat tour and cooking lessons with Mr Cu. It was fun for us. We were upgraded to the top floor but the room was not clean e. g. candy wrappers from previous guest, mirror is not clean and the bathroom has molds. We asked to be transfered to another room and they did. The next room was okay but I woke up in the middle of the night smelling molds again. I hope they will make some updates of the building. Second, the breakfast is okay but a bit limited. Lastly, we felt that the ladies at the reception are intrusive. For example, the moment we arrived, we just want a rest as we were tired but she was selling us many many things like tours or tailors and repeat many unnecessary information which was annoying for us. They keep asking questions like who is your taxi driver, where are you going, which store?.. I mean, I understand they get some kind of commision but please we are on our holiday and we decide where to buy stuff. On our last day, the lady tried to convinced us to stay one more night in their hotel and beg to give them 10 review which didnt sit well on us.

139021,Ideal Homestay to get out of the crowds. The son speaks English, the parents do not, but they are sweethearts. Always willing to help and smiling. The beach is at 10 min walk and 3 in the motorcycle. If you rent one they'll let you park it inside the homestay. It's possible to wake up every morning and swim in the ocean (I did). You can order your breakfast (made to order), go to the beach, swim and when you come back, it's waiting for you in the room, where you can enjoy it in the spacious AC Room. I was able to leave my heavy luggage with them for 3 days, at no charge, I recommend tipping though, this is a true Homestay (they live next door), they are building it up based on our visits. Quiet and a breath of fresh air (ironically in a superhot & humid weather) compared to downtown Hoi An. 15min motorcycle ride through an amazing landscape (see photos). You can find better? probably (closer to the beach... i saw a couple of places, but it's hard to beat the value.

Phoung and his lovely wife took so well care of me, they treat their guests literally like family. I initially wanted to stay only one night as a stop over coming from Sapa, heading to Hanoi. However I liked it so much instantly, that I decided to stay 2 nights. The freshly cooked breakfast and dinner, eaten together with the family, was the best meals I have had in Vietnam. Phoung brought me on a boat trip on Thac Ba Lake, which was amazing. In the evening he brought me and one other guest from India to play volleyball and dance together with his wife and her friends in the village.

138724,Nice hotel, but very busy with locals this time of year. Appears that several members of the staff are trainees, and were frazzled with the number of people checking in at the same time. The breakfast buffet was very good, the dinner buffet was not ideal for vegetarians, but the choices for others were very good. The hotel is a nice modern hotel with 3 towers of rooms connected by a bridge. Nice view of Lan Ha bay from each room. It is a short walk into town, or you can arrange for an electric car to take you.- for 10,000 vnd ea. All in all, a very nice hotel, but the experience would have been better had it not been so noisy. Not the hotel's fault, it's the locals having a good time on their vacy. :).. That being said, I would stay here again. Rooms a a little small, but manageable. The bathroom just has an open bathtub to shower...Very inefficient. Very messy.

I thoroughly recommend this hotel and can't believe it isn't at least 4 stars. It is a little away from the main area but if you don't mind riding a scooter and really getting lost in the city and realising how much that has to offer or catching a grab taxi it is really worth while.

544,Nice looking room, spacious with a bath. Our mistake not to check but about 1. 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started. This is a really noisy place, the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning (5. 30am) people using power tools. There are rodents in the roof. The bathroom looks great but the water doesn't flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over. The bath is really nice, but the hot water only fills about 1/5 of it at a time. Not that we would have used it, as it was too cold, but the pool was empty. Staff at reception were unwelcoming, didn't provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don't speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also, so made it hard to communicate at all. An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren't asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine, but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc. let alone wanted something else. We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves. When we realised this wasn't going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out. We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left. No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty because the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were 'unlaunderable' and had to pay 180,000 dong to replace them! So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins. So, this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam and don't recommend it at all. If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access. ####[['Nice looking room , spacious with a bath', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our mistake not to check but about 1 . 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['This is a really noisy place , the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['people using power tools', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['There are rodents in the roof', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The bathroom looks grea', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["the water doesn ' t flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The bath is really nice', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the hot water only fills about 1 / 5 of it at a time', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Not that we would have used it , as it was too cold , but the pool was empty', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["Staff at reception were unwelcoming , didn ' t provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don ' t speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also , so made it hard to communicate at all", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren ' t asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine , but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc . let alone wanted something else", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["When we realised this wasn ' t going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were ' unlaunderable ' and had to pay 180 , 000 dong to replace them", 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["don ' t recommend it at all", 'Loyalty', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

958,We had 2 rooms with street view. The rooms were a bit musty but once the aircon kicked in it wasn't too bad. Beds are hard and water flows out from shower to toilet room. There is a lift to ground floor but you then need to go down another 2 set of stairs to get to the pool. Not good for people in wheelchairs or with mobility issues. I ended up having to go outside and walk down driveway to get to pool. Repeatedly asked to get mini fridge replaced in one room but they had no idea. Kept saying yes and everyday it still didn't work. Gave up after 3 days. The breakfast was quite good. Had a variety of food for buffet and even on the day they did a la carte there was a good choice. Only a 10 min walk to night market. The pool looked nice and the kids enjoyed it. They do supply a towel for swimming. They need more people that can understand English at the front desk. Not sure I would use it again but it was fairly cheap. The ground floor was in construction and nothing down there, just empty rooms. Reception was on 1st floor.

807,It was very affordable and in a good location. It's close to My Anh Beach and the restaurants of An Thương. The private rooms are still at great prices, and come with a kettle, sink, and private bathroom. And the renter can control the air conditioner. I rate the private room at an 8 because it is more like a normal hotel room, but at 1/3 the cost of a cheap hotel. In the group rooms, the air conditioner is only turned on from 9pm to 7am, so the room is too hot to be in during the daytime. Additionally, there are no windows in the group rooms, so the air is very stale. I give the group rooms and bathrooms a 5/10. ####[['It was very affordable', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['in a good location', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["It ' s close to My Anh Beach and the restaurants of An Thương", 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The private rooms are still at great prices', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['come with a kettle , sink , and private bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the renter can control the air conditioner', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I rate the private room at an 8 because it is more like a normal hotel room , but at 1 / 3 the cost of a cheap hotel', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['the air conditioner is only turned on from 9pm to 7am , so the room is too hot to be in during the daytime', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['there are no windows in the group rooms , so the air is very stale', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I give the group rooms and bathrooms a 5 / 10', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

1743,We had the most wonderful two nights at the viet nhat hotel. Mrs Phuong and Mr Trung were the most lovely hosts we have had during our travels. Both went above and beyond to make our stay more comfortable. We had delicious breakfasts included made by Mrs Phuong, she even gave us free dragon fruit on the side. Mr Trung was so sweet always sharing his fruit with us and when we left sent us off with apples and water bottles. He even drove us to the bus stop because we couldn’t find a grab to take us. Mrs Phuong woke up to let us in when we arrived at 1am and gave us a lovely room. They had an elevator as well which was heaven for us after being up 5 flights of stairs in Hanoi! The room was clean, spacious and had a balcony, TV and refrigerator. The hotel is right opposite the train station so easy to get to. We rented bikes from them for only 100K a day, Mrs Phuong gave me a quick lesson as I hadn’t rode for years. Overall a lovely stay and would recommend to anyone. Hosts so kind, helpful and generous as well as a lovely hotel for such a good price!

1066,Amazing service from Imperial. Attentive and went out of their way to make sure I was safe and comfortable. Gave me tips to maximize my stay. Although I had no breakfast included in my booking, the hotel prepared a huge take away breakfast as I had an 6. 30 am pick up to Sapa, Before arriving to Vietnam I wanted to arrange a trip to Sapa as I had limited time in Vietnam. I was struggling to find something on the internet. The hotel connected me to the tour desk and Ian was amazing. He answered all my questions and advised the best options for my limited time. He customised a trip to Sapa with my own guide and arrange an excellent hotel there as well. Fantastic location in the heart of old quarter. 5 minutes walk to everything and still very quiet.

The room (double room with private bathroom) was EXTREMELY noisy - and this is coming someone who isn't very sensitive to noise/can sleep almost everywhere. I understand it's impossible for it to be completely quiet as the room faces the street and is opposite a school but better windows really need to be installed or, at the very least, thicker velvet curtains that would keep the sound out. On top of that, there was a hole in the upper pane of balcony doors.

It's great value for money! The bathroom was connected to the one next door and so we could hear everything that the guests next door were saying. It's worth noting that two of the dogs are very friendly and like being petted, but two of them are not. We observed them snapping at/biting several other guests who went to touch them a couple of times.

138400,First impressions - amazing use of space and a great meet and greet. Breakfast - excellent, very fresh and different each day Laundry service - free and done for you, which is just great! Location - whilst not the most central location, the host got us taxi's as we couldn't use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim! We also used Google maps and the local bus, which is very cheap and reliable! So I didn't find location as issue at all. My husband loved the free gym! Whilst we did love our stay I feel it necessary to talk about what we didn't like. This place doesn't know what it wants yo be! It's guests are mainly young English teachers who actually live there medium to long term, so it's their home! We felt a bit like we were staying in their house. They are young, and with that came lots of night time noise, and socialising with friends not guests of the homestay right under our window until 2am on a couple of occasions. I expect young people to be noisy, it's normal, but I felt at the cost to other guests. This is because the place is mixed with different types of guests, and doesn't really have a true identity. This mixed with a very hard uncomfortable bed equaled a major lack of sleep for me! However, we did still enjoy our booking, but I feel this feedback is necessary for mid age guests, where noise might be an issue. ####[['amazing use of space and a great meet and greet', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast - excellent , very fresh and different each day', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Laundry service - free and done for you , which is just great', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Location - whilst not the most central location', 'Amenity', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ["the host got us taxi ' s as we couldn ' t use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['My husband loved the free gym', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we did love our stay', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we did still enjoy our booking', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

138483,For our wedding anniversary celebration, my family decided to stay at this lovely resort called Memorina. And wow, did it surpass our expectations! Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery, it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape. The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat, bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region. We spent hours wandering around the resort, discovering charming nooks, admiring the vibrant plant life, and even giving fishing a shot. One of the highlights was visiting the sheepfold – an experience that not only captivated us but also filled our kids with wide-eyed wonder. Watching their faces light up as they interacted with the sheep was absolutely heartwarming.

The decor of the room and the hotel in general was very nice! They have used natural materials in a very pleasing and balanced way. The tea set that they provided in the room was exceptional – it came with loose leaf tea, a kettle with a built-in sieve and two beautiful ceramic cups. We had a lovely view of the emerging skyline in the vibrant city of Da Nang. The room had a balcony and natural light coming in from 2 directions. The location is convenient. It's in the heart of the city – just 10-15 minutes from any other part of the city including the airport! ####[['The staff was really professional and went beyond their way to help us out', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We had forgotten our medicine pouch in the room after checking out .

139572,Bamboo Farmstay is where I enjoyed the most authentic Vietnamese hospitality experience of my entire trip. The owner, Nam, his sister, and the entire family were extremely kind, attentive, and caring throughout our stay. Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh, but I insisted on paying for it, as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me. Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex, a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future. I highly recommend visiting this area now, before the crowds descend. Nam's farmstay is a hidden gem, and I'm glad I chose it over other homestays that were located in a cramped area with a challenging road. This farmstay, on the other hand, is situated on a good road, close to the main thoroughfare that leads to two of Ninh Binh's main attractions: the pagoda and the river tour. The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent, and the Vietnamese cuisine they serve is simply delicious. Although they normally close at 9 PM, they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry. While the rooms are quite basic, they offer air conditioning and hot showers, and for the price, they are an unbeatable deal - under $10 per night! You'll also have the chance to stay in a charming bamboo bungalow, which is a real treat. All in all, I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future. I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience. ####[['The owner , Nam , his sister , and the entire family were extremely kind , attentive , and caring throughout our stay', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh , but I insisted on paying for it , as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex , a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I highly recommend visiting this area now', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Although they normally close at 9 PM , they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['While the rooms are quite basic , they offer air conditioning and hot showers , and for the price , they are an unbeatable deal - under $ 10 per night', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

All our requests were addressed, our rooms were very good and we could choose the rooms that most met our expectations. The cleaning service was very good, our towels were changed daily, rooms were cleaned and the water supplied daily. We could use bikes to reach Old Town, but you can easily walk there and enjoy this part of Hoi An as much as you wish. The pool was ok. not too big though but it was refreshing to be able to use it after our short trips. It was very hot during our stay and the pool was a blessing. It was quiet and peaceful at night too. The coffee was good too! The location although very close to town is also in a close proximity to a rather noisy bridge - a metal crate bridge for scooters and you can hear the noise when you use the pool.

There is such kind staff in the breakfast, so attentive to be sure the guests are comfortable and happy. My bed and pillows were so comfortable (standard double room) and a really nice marble shower. I did not have a window but i wouldn’t have opened it bc the a/c was on and i wouldn’t want to let mosquitos in. The room did not need a window, it felt very open and nice and very sweetly furnished — the designer of the hotel had very good taste. Especially the huge fuchsia colored chandelier in the lobby!

609,rien My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare. From the outset, the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous. The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic English. In a highly unprofessional move, he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking. com platform, promising “better apartments, better views, and more check-in options.” He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times! And after reading reviews from previous guests, I discovered that those who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn’t get any of the promised benefits. The deceit didn’t stop there. On the check-in day, the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower. This was a complete bait and switch, and it left us feeling utterly duped. To add insult to injury, the apartment itself was a disaster. The furniture was old, worn, and filthy, and the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online. It was smaller, older, and lacked any charm or modern decoration. The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding. As if that weren’t enough, the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay. We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water. It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard.

138861,Comfortable bed. Clean rooms. Great location. Pool was nice. Brutal check out experience. They advertise 24 hour reception so I thought nothing of checking out early in the morning to catch my 6 AM bus to the airport. There was nobody in reception except a security guard who, upon my spouse and I loading our bags onto the bus, proceeded to make a scene (yelling at myself and the driver) that I had yet to pay. I went inside to pay and found out he (security guard) could not administer payment. He had trouble getting ahold of the man in charge of reception. Meanwhile my bus driver was beginning to unload our things and was attempting to kick us off the bus as we were now behind schedule. I pleaded to him, explaining that the hotel had my credit info and I could be billed, and made the same plea to the security guard. To no avail. I was now refusing to get off the bus because I had a flight to catch, and caught between two men screaming at eachother and at me. I'm not sure I've faced that level of anxiety before in my life. All due to a false promise of 24 hour reception. Anyway, don't rely on the 24 hour reception, and don't expect to be treated with common decency by the staff (this doesn't apply to the guy working reception, he was actually kind and respectful). ####[['Comfortable bed .

1354,very clean. Staff is very nice and Family dinners were very delicious. An helped us check in really early in the morning and kept checking with us during the whole stay, which was lovely. They dropped me off at the bus station for Mui Ne which was above and beyond. This hostel isn’t the same one that all the reviews rave about because they moved during Covid. Booking’s description says there’s a patio bar and has lots of reviews talk about the roof, and at this location those don’t exist. Also, on booking. com the address is wrong (correct address as of 4/23 is Alley 1/5A, Đường Lê Hồng Phong, Phường 4, Thành phố Đà Lạt, Lâm Đồng, Vietnam) which meant that I showed up to the old hostel address at 4:30 in the morning. Not ideal. We did the classic Mr. Peace tour, which was okay but on the pricier side compared to the rest of vietnam. 35$ for the day, which didn’t include meals, weasel coffee, or gas if you drive yourself. You get to see a lot though which is cool. ####[['very clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Staff is very nice and Family dinners were very delicious', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['An helped us check in really early in the morning and kept checking with us during the whole stay , which was lovely', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They dropped me off at the bus station for Mui Ne which was above and beyond', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We did the classic Mr .

253,A Friend's Recommendation Unveils the Magic of Zizi Homestay in Sapa I am filled with immense excitement as I recount my extraordinary journey to the captivating landscapes of Sapa, Vietnam. Inspired by a friend's heartfelt recommendation, I embarked on a quest to discover the hidden treasures of this enchanting region. My adventure led me to the remarkable Zizi Homestay, and I can confidently say that it was an experience that exceeded all expectations—a journey that was truly worth every moment. Upon arriving at Zizi Homestay, I was instantly captivated by the beauty of its surroundings. Nestled amidst the awe-inspiring landscapes of Sapa, it stood as a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and culture. The gentle embrace of Zizi's warm hospitality and the sincere smiles of the Hmong people made me feel instantly at ease. It was evident from the very beginning that my friend's recommendation was a precious gift. The allure of Zizi Homestay extended far beyond its idyllic setting. It was a gateway to the vibrant tapestry of Hmong culture. With boundless enthusiasm, Zizi welcomed me into her world, eager to share the rich heritage and traditions of her community. I was invited to immerse myself in the fascinating art of batik dyeing, guided by the skilled hands of the Hmong artisans. It was a mesmerizing experience that allowed me to witness firsthand the intricate craftsmanship and the indomitable spirit woven into every stitch. Throughout my stay, Zizi proved to be an extraordinary hostess, going above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of my journey was filled with wonder and delight. From guiding me on breathtaking treks through the emerald rice terraces to introducing me to the flavors of traditional Hmong cuisine, Zizi's genuine care and passion created an atmosphere of true warmth and hospitality. ####[]

139010,The food and service staff were all excellent. I found the booking process very irritating, I received several Whats App calls and texts in the days before the cruise from the sales consultant Hang Nga telling me she had a big problem because she had double booked my room, she wanted me to spend one night in a cheaper room then move to my original booked room for the second night. I found her texts to be increasingly bizarre and late at night. She then told me she had a sick child and needed my help. She then offered to buy me a drink in Hanoi if I would just accept her plan to use the cheaper room. She was concerned about her job and realised she had made a big mistake. I was paying a lot of money for this cruise and did not want to move rooms. I told her it was her problem and she would have to fix it. I was traveling with friends and wanted to treat myself to a nice room on this cruise. Her constant texts caused me al lot of unnecessary stress in the days before getting on the cruise. The 2nd day outing wasn't very interesting. The tour guide for the day was annoying and kept asking for a tip. ####[['The food and service staff were all excellent', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I found the booking process very irritating', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The tour guide for the day was annoying and kept asking for a tip', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

138719,No breakfast, room had not been cleaned for three days. Awful smell in bathroom. We had to go and ask for clean towels . No fan or air conditioner in room. Shower, water did not run properly. Third morning, shower water was cold. Everything could be better. The name of this hotel is not the White House delux but the White House. Driver spent over half an hour trying to find this hotel because incorrect name. When we finally ascertained that the White House was the hotel that we booked, driver paid the staff out asking why was it called the White House delux, staff just laughed. Staff could not speak any english. Communication was poor. Often there was no one at reception. We booked a bus through reception for nha trang and were told it was going to leave at 8. 30am. We were told we could pay with credit card on leaving. We were told in four different times that the bus would leave at 8. 30am. In the morning when we were leaving we could not have a shower because the water was cold. When we got to reception at 7. 15am we were told that the bus was leaving at 7. 40 am. Then we were told that we had to pay the hotel and bus fare in cash. After finalising the bill the staff grabbed our bags and took off from the hotel and said we had to hurry for the bus. He then disappeared into the street somewhere with our bags. We could not see him anywhere. Finally we saw him up the road dragging our bags. Eventually we got to the bus and an argument between the driver and staff because we were late. When we arrived in nha trang we had notification from booking. com that we had stayed for two days instead of the three days that we had booked.

138789,Staff was great and super helpful. Breakfast was good, it was nice that you can order different dishes every morning from the menu on top of the buffet.

Surfaces in the room were somewhat worn out, and there was some visible water damage in the bathroom, tiles were cracked etc. You could hear all the noises from the hallway. The walls/windows were so thin, that it felt like the windows were open because the traffic noises were so loud, and it was a little hard to sleep. Update // They asked us to do a written review about the hotel upon check out. We wrote same things on that and here in the booking review. Mostly great things about the service and staff, only complaints was the noises and the fact that the room might need some updates/renovations. We waited in the hotel lobby for a car to pick us up to the airport, and the manager came to us apologizing and they gave us a 50% refund from the car service. We thought that was unnessecary, but it felt nice that they reacted to our feedback. I also wrote this booking review waiting in the lobby, usually I wait to get out of the hotel to do that, I should’ve done it now too. The manager had seen my booking review and came back to talk to us, asking us to change the review from 8 to 10. We felt super uncomfortable that he asked us to do so. We just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. For that point we had nothing but great things to say about the staff, but now it left us with a bad taste to our mouths, and this wasn’t a great ending to our 2-week trip to Vietnam, which had been nothing but lovely so far. I had to lower the grade because we didn’t appreciate this kind of doing. ####[['Staff was great and super helpful .

946,Everything. A suggestion for improvement would be to have a second card to access the room. if travelling in a group, this may be of inconvenience if you decide to return to the hotel at different times. Another suggestion for improvement (unless I missed it) would be to have a leaflet by the hotel to keep with useful local information.

139222,From the moment I set foot in the door the staff were amazing from start to finish. Tommy (Manh) looked after me like I was part of his family. I ended up getting scammed by a cab driver as it was my first trip to Hanoi and I didn't know any better. 1 call to Tommy and he came straight over to sort it out! He calls you cabs, rents you bikes, changes money cheaply and get you sim cards. Its a hotel but also a one stop for all your needs becuase they really care about you having the best time possible. I cannot speak highly enough of my experience there with them. I had a balcony room, it was very clean, serviced each day I was there and everything worked as I should have. If you are looking to rent a place in the heart of old quarter, which is within walking distance of a lot of things to do, then this is definitely the place to go! Oh and make sure you get the breakfast. It was fantastic 12/10 That I had to leave! I definitely could have done a few more days there if I didn't have other places to go. ####[['From the moment I set foot in the door the staff were amazing from start to finish', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Tommy ( Manh ) looked after me like I was part of his family', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I had a balcony room , it was very clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['serviced each day I was there and everything worked as I should have', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['If you are looking to rent a place in the heart of old quarter , which is within walking distance of a lot of things to do , then this is definitely the place to go', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Oh and make sure you get the breakfast .

Good breakfast (the menu offers 16 dishes) and we were invited to join a dinner with the host family and other guests (for 120000VND per pax) with lots of vietnamese traditional dishes. The host is very nice and also helped us to book a transfer to Catba.

138322,This place only cost £13 a night for a double room so it was very cheap for Hanoi. The man behind the desk was helpful. He came up to my room when I couldn't get the air conditioning to work (there is a mains switch you need to turn on before you can use the remote control). He also booked me a taxi for the early hours the next morning to go to the airport, and it was cheaper than Grab. The location is really good, in a side street very close to the historic centre with loads of bars and restaurants on the doorstep. Towels are provided as well as toothbrush, comb, shampoo and shower gel (although it was a whitening one so I avoided). It didn't seem very clean, there were two hairs on the bed that didn't belong to me. The light fittings on the wall were very dusty and one of them didn't work. The bed was not very comfy. The air conditioning did work but the unit looked ancient and it made a lot of noise. The bathroom is in need of replacing, the tiles and taps/shower were all looking very worn/rusty. There is no lift so it is a lot of stairs to walk up with luggage. ####[['This place only cost £ 13 a night for a double room so it was very cheap for Hanoi', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The man behind the desk was helpful', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["He came up to my room when I couldn ' t get the air conditioning to work", 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['He also booked me a taxi for the early hours the next morning to go to the airport , and it was cheaper than Grab', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The location is really good', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['in a side street very close to the historic centre with loads of bars and restaurants on the doorstep', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Towels are provided as well as toothbrush , comb , shampoo and shower gel', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["It didn ' t seem very clean", 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ["there were two hairs on the bed that didn ' t belong to me", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["The light fittings on the wall were very dusty and one of them didn ' t work", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The bed was not very comfy', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The air conditioning did work but the unit looked ancient and it made a lot of noise', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The bathroom is in need of replacing', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the tiles and taps / shower were all looking very worn / rusty', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['There is no lift so it is a lot of stairs to walk up with luggage', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

139136,the staff couldn’t speak English but they did their best to help us. they solved the issue below properly. location was good and on walkable distance to some shops. the room was nice and big and clean. the staff helped us book a private chauffeur to go the green tea islands which was great! definitely recommend to go there. we booked a massage at the hotel as we thought this would be good (tecco hotel & spa). we were sent to separate rooms and had to wait there. two ladies came and did our massage… not a good massage!! she was sitting on the massage table (very lazy), was messaging on her phone and even took a phone call during the massage. also we were promised a 1-hour massage but we only got a 20 minute massage. the staff told us that the deal is 20 minute massage and then a spa for the rest of the hour. however, the spa was literally just a shower and a bathtub. if you go to this hotel, then DO NOT take a spa+massage. luckily the staff solved this properly and we only paid for a 20 minute massage. breakfast is from 6-8 which is too early. we did it our first night but skipped it on our second day. ####[['the staff couldn ’ t speak English but they did their best to help us', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['they solved the issue below properly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['location was good and on walkable distance to some shops', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the room was nice and big and clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the staff helped us book a private chauffeur to go the green tea islands which was great', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['definitely recommend to go there', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we booked a massage at the hotel as we thought this would be good', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['two ladies came and did our massage … not a good massage', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['she was sitting on the massage table ( very lazy ), was messaging on her phone and even took a phone call during the massage', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['we were promised a 1 - hour massage but we only got a 20 minute massage', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the staff told us that the deal is 20 minute massage and then a spa for the rest of the hour . however , the spa was literally just a shower and a bathtub', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['breakfast is from 6 - 8 which is too early', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

140102,Staff were friendly, helpful, polite. We ended up booking Hà Long Bay tour, Sapa trekking tour, and Nimh Binh with them for the convenience and price. Good advice would be to not book too early and check the weather...better to go sooner while the weather is tame than to be pushed for time and have to cancel some things. Luckily for us, we had time. The location is great and we used this hotel as a base as we did 1-3 day trips around Hanoi. They were great with communication and super accommodating. Highly recommend as a good accomodation for the cost. Hotel construction started at 7:30-11am and we weren't warnded/informed. They were very apologetic about it and we are totally understanding as they have to do it at some point. It would just be considerate to let guests know beforehand (and I have given this same feedback on their checkout form).Still, the room is nice and I would come back to stay here! Thank you to the amazing staff! ####[['Staff were friendly , helpful , polite', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Good advice would be to not book too early and check the weather ... better to go sooner while the weather is tame than to be pushed for time and have to cancel some things', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The location is great and we used this hotel as a base as we did 1 - 3 day trips around Hanoi', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They were great with communication and super accommodating', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Highly recommend as a good accomodation for the cost', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["Hotel construction started at 7 : 30 - 11am and we weren ' t warnded / informed", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['They were very apologetic about it and we are totally understanding as they have to do it at some point', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['the room is nice', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I would come back to stay here', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Thank you to the amazing staff', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

1516,This is a cozy family home that has everything you need. Don't expect anything too fancy though. As a solo travel who usually stays at hostels, it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel. The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening. The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I've stayed at. Bathroom was shared but was always empty. The private room also locks. Everything I could ask for! Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market. The stairs inside the home are a little challenging. The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small (I had to navigate them going down with my feet sideways). Fortunately, my room was on the first level above ground, but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you. Also, finding the apartment was a little tricky. Finding the address of the building was fine. Take the concrete stairs up a flight and go down the first hall to your right. There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it's easy to miss. I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end, but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn't confirm if I was at the right place. I left but ended up being redirected back to the apartment. The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English. The whole family is lovely, but it can be hard to find the apartment. ####[['This is a cozy family home that has everything you need', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I ' ve stayed at", 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Bathroom was shared but was always empty', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The private room also locks', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Everything I could ask for', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The stairs inside the home are a little challenging', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['finding the apartment was a little tricky', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['my room was on the first level above ground , but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The whole family is lovely', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it can be hard to find the apartment', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end , but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn ' t confirm if I was at the right place", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it ' s easy to miss", 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]
1617,Great views. Great location. Awesome pool with swim-up bar. Super comfortable bed. Surprisingly quiet at night. Staff are all amazingly polite, professional, and friendly. Great buffet breakfast options (Eastern and Western). Only a 5-minute walk to the night market. Family friendly. Couple friendly. A little pricey, but it's a luxury resort, so that's to be expected. And being an upscale resort, there are some entitled guests that come there and are unnecessarily rude to staff for things that are out of the staff's control (and the staff were all very polite and professional in response)... but those guests' behavior is not the hotel's fault.

524,We ended up staying at the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, so I can only comment on that. Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom. We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool. Breakfast was very good and a sensible price. if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel. Very handy little shop called Moon Milk on the street corner. A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage. The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing. We landed on a (relatively) cold and rainy evening and took the long taxi ride from Da Nang airport. The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance. We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that. There was a notice on the door saying to go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, giving the address. A sketch map would have been useful! It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel. The gentleman on reception took us up to a room, leading in and coming back out very rapidly. Obviously there was some kind of problem, and he wished to be professional about it. He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card. We were ushered to another room, which was clearly an upgrade. Whilst it lacked a couple of things (such as a toilet roll, which appeared the next day), it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom. To the credit of the manager, he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances. ####[['Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast was very good and a sensible price', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['A sketch map would have been useful', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The gentleman on reception took us up to a room , leading in and coming back out very rapidly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Obviously there was some kind of problem , and he wished to be professional about it', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['We were ushered to another room , which was clearly an upgrade', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Whilst it lacked a couple of thing', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['To the credit of the manager , he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

1439,The property is converted from an old government office building to homestay. Its design is based on the concept of local ethnic groups in Sapa. You could see the owner put a lot of efforts on the design and materials used. Many recycled and traditional local ethnic group materials are used in the homestay. The staff were super helpful and friendly during my stay. They recommended some cafes with awesome view and try their best to fulfill my request. This homestay serve vegan food for lunch and dinner. I tried their local Vietnamese style began food and it was delicious. The chef has many years of working experience in hospitality line. She worked in 5-stars resorts in South East Asia and Middle East. As it was low season due to covid-19, the owner took extra mile by offering me a personal trip from Sapa to Y Ty when i asked him for tour package. It was a wonderful experience although the journey was not easy for me. In short, the price/night is considered under value (properly due to low season and covid-19) in view of the level of services provided by them.

1546,Location was convenient and staff were really helpful and friendly. We stayed in room 109 which was a family room. The room was extremely dark as our window looked out onto a wall and a roof top with broken air conditioner units on. We booked a family room as we were travelling with our teenage son - house keeping did not replace or restock shower gel, towels or bathroom mats during out 3 night stay. They took the dirty towels away without replacing new ones. I had to constantly ask house keeping to replace our towels. The room was dusty and there were lots of small insects in the room. No counter space in the bathroom to leave toiletries. Limited hanging space/hooks to hang wet towels. Very poor for a family room. Breakfast buffet was basic, bar staff were friendly, but had no idea how to make basic cocktails even though they were on the drinks menu. ####[['Location was convenient', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['staff were really helpful and friendly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room was extremely dark as our window looked out onto a wall and a roof top with broken air conditioner units on', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['house keeping did not replace or restock shower gel , towels or bathroom mats during out 3 night stay', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['They took the dirty towels away without replacing new ones', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I had to constantly ask house keeping to replace our towels', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The room was dusty and there were lots of small insects in the room', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['No counter space in the bathroom to leave toiletries', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Limited hanging space / hooks to hang wet towels', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast buffet was basic', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['bar staff were friendly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['but had no idea how to make basic cocktails even though they were on the drinks menu', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Very poor for a family room', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

1232,Our room was great- large, all wood, with a balcony facing the valley and a hot tub in the bathroom. Staff were super friendly and helpful.

Although it is close to Bui Vien street (also known as a walking party street), the guesthouse is located in a little alley, where the music from the bars can't be heard. The highlight of my stay was Ms Vy, she is an excellent host! Ms Vy accompanied me to the local banh mi festival that was happening during my stay. She was great, explaining the local dishes and helping me order food. With her I got to try many delicious Vietnamese food. After that we went on a walk and did a little bit of sightseeing. She also gave a little map with everything explained, including some words in Vietnamese in case you need to ask directions to locals! She's a lovely person and I enjoyed a lot spending time with her. I truly recommend staying at Vy Khanh Guesthouse! What a lovely day I spent in Ho Chi Minh!

138760,The pool was nice. The location (close to the night market) was also good. I would really not recommend this hotel. We are by no means picky people and have travelled extensively, but this is one of the worst hotels we have ever encountered in terms of price/quality. The room was not cleaned before our arrival (two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it, thus also no clean towels. The place did not only have cockroaches upon arrival, but we kept encountering them. Although we know this might just be the climate, we did not encounter them anywhere else during 3 weeks in Vietnam. The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up, which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm. The water pressure was almost non existent. The airconditioning did not work most of the time. Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible. The staff did not speak a word of English. We had to communicate via Google translate. Overall, this place calls itself a resort, but in comparison with some of the significantly lower priced homestays or other hotels we had throughout three weeks in Vietnam, we would barely call this place a hotel and definitely not a resort. The sun was not present during our 3 days in Phu Quoc, but the 'cosy' part of 'suncosy' was even more absent than the sun. ####[['The pool was nice', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The location ( close to the night market ) was also good', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I would really not recommend this hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The room was not cleaned before our arrival ( two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom ), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it , thus also no clean towels', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up , which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The water pressure was almost non existent .', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The airconditioning did not work most of the time', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The staff did not speak a word of English .

Overall we had a lovely stay in sapa. We were on the 5th floor city view room and it was very noisy, possible this is not isolated to this particular hotel as the town is very busy. We had a connecting room but the balcony door did not lock in one of the rooms. And in the night a very strong smell of cigarette smoke wafted through our room through the aircon vent. Someone clearly smoking in their room or near the ducts, it was bad enough to wake us.

139604,Maison Vy is absolutely gorgeous! Our room was spacious and well thought out, and I appreciated the commitment to environmentalism such as reusable glass bottles for water (instead of plastic water bottles like most hotels). The service was warm, efficient, and attentive, and everyone spoke English fluently. The pool is small and shallow, so it is only good for lounging around and sunbathing. There were limited options at breakfast, which was just ok. That was not a huge issue, though, because we wanted to explore the food in the city. Wifi was spotty, but we noticed that the internet service at most hotels in Vietnam were like that. ####[['Our room was spacious and well thought out', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The service was warm , efficient , and attentive , and everyone spoke English fluently', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The pool is small and shallow , so it is only good for lounging around and sunbathing', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['There were limited options at breakfast , which was just ok', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Wifi was spotty', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

Considering we also purchased the daily £22 breakfast for 2 which was pretty pricey for Vietnam I would have appreciated some form of compensation given it’s a 5 star and the issues we had - We also had to pay a £300 deposit on the room when we arrived which made no sense considering the room showed lots of signs of wear and tear ####[['We booked the hotel for the reason it was ‘ 5 star ’ and had a bath on the balcony …. when we arrived the bath for the room we were given was in a disgusting state we did not want to get in it', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We complained and they said they ’ d clean it but when we returned to the room it looking in the same state', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['so after complaining again they moved us to a new room that was effort considering we had to repack', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['then they gave us a smaller room , with a slightly nicer bath , but still the fixtures and fittings were so old and outdated it looked grim', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We also had to pay a £ 300 deposit on the room when we arrived which made no sense considering the room showed lots of signs of wear and tear', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['we also purchased the daily £ 22 breakfast for 2 which was pretty pricey for Vietnam', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

The air conditioner did not cool the room sufficiently, so it was extremely hot, and water was leaking through the AC evaporator. The staff was pleasant and helpful, but communication was occasionally difficult due to their limited English level. For example, when I was in the taxi, the driver asked them in "Vietnamese" if I could exchange money in the hotel, because I live in Korea and had korean wons, and they said yes no problem, but when I arrived, they said I had to go to Saigon (mainland Vietnam) because they don't exchange korean won in Phu quoc, which I could had already done if I had known this.

139274,Location was great, away from the main road, so no traffic noise Plenty cheap local places to eat along the main street, as you come out of the guesthouse, Great communal areas above & at the side of the reception, with a bar & cafe, Not a fan of touristy stuff, so it was great to rent a good motorbike from the guesthouse & explore the Island for 3x days, well worth doing If you wanna see the "Real" markets walk down to the night market area & go over the bridge, that is where the "Real" Phu Quoc is, well worth exploring that area, which is not that far of a walk from the guesthouse I would certainly recommend this guesthouse ####[['Location was great , away from the main road , so no traffic noise', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Plenty cheap local places to eat along the main street , as you come out of the guesthouse', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Great communal areas above & at the side of the reception , with a bar & cafe', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it was great to rent a good motorbike from the guesthouse', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I would certainly recommend this guesthouse', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

576,All of the staff was super nice and very responsive to our needs.

The hotel is a 10-min walk from the city center and there are only 6 rooms, which makes it quieter at night. We could also use the shared kitchen to cook our baby meals. Only Nhi and his girlfriend speak good English, so it can be difficult to get understood with the others. I think it’s part of the experience and enjoy that, but be warned. Breakfast a bit expensive for what you get, that being said I do recommend the my quang!The water pressure was very poor on the 2nd floor, but we had no such issue in the family room on the ground floor. ####[['All of the staff was super nice and very responsive to our needs', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They upgraded us for free to a family room after 1 night', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['because they realised we were lacking space with our toddler and all our luggage', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The family room was indeed much bigger , with two comfortable queen beds', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hotel is a 10 - min walk from the city center', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['there are only 6 rooms , which makes it quieter at night', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We could also use the shared kitchen to cook our baby meals', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Only Nhi and his girlfriend speak good English , so it can be difficult to get understood with the others', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['We didn ’ t try the pool because it was so rainy and not so hot , but it looked welcoming', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The water pressure was very poor on the 2nd floor', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['I think it ’ s part of the experience and enjoy that , but be warned', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast a bit expensive for what you get', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['that being said I do recommend the my quang', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we had no such issue in the family room on the ground floor', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

The elevator was small but worked just fine. I've read some reviews that you need to go up through small stairs, but that happened if your property is at 11th floor above. Ours was in 10th so it was fine. The host was very communicative and supportive during our stay. p. s. They also had motorbike rent, but manual only. The bed was a bit thinner that usual bed, so it was not as comfy as your common hotel bed, but we slept just fine. The blanket was very comfortable though so it helped. The ceiling was a bit low and the room was a bit older than the photos, but it was fine. There's no good food around the place and it was about 10 mins by motorbike from Old Quarter. So, you have to rent motorbike if you wanna go to the nearest popular spots. However, it was nice to have a quiet place a bit further from the busy centre of Hanoi. ####[['The room was spacious and had very wide windows , it was so pleasant to look at the view', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The bathroom was also clean and spacious', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['It has lots of hangers which was very useful for our winter jackets', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They also had Netflix on the TV right in front of the bed , which made this place felt more homey', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The elevator was small but worked just fine', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The host was very communicative and supportive during our stay', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They also had motorbike rent , but manual only', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The bed was a bit thinner that usual bed , so it was not as comfy as your common hotel bed , but we slept just fine', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The blanket was very comfortable though so it helped', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The ceiling was a bit low and the room was a bit older than the photos , but it was fine', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [', you hav', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [', it was nice to have a quiet place a bit further from the busy centre of Hanoi', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

139662,Nothing The room was not cleaned properly when we arrived. They offered an “upgrade” as compensation but this room was also dirty. The buns were full of trash, hair all over the floor and bed, stains on the sheets, etc. After complaining again, it was clear this was the cleaning standard of the hotel so being tired from our trip we decided to just accept it. The next day, whilst we were out on a tour, my booking was marked as a no show. We spoke to staff that evening and they said it was a mistake so I booked again for the following night. This time it was cancelled again during the night. They clearly didn’t want me to write a bad review and do this whenever there are complaints. I had to request a review form off booking. com support to write this. I would not trust the review score at all.

140239,Pretty much the perfect stay. This resort is pretty amazing. It's right on the ocean and has got a gigantic swimming pool with a bar in it and tons of comfy mattresses and long chairs to chill, enjoy the sun and read a book. The three restaurants on site are pretty good and the breakfast definitely wins it all. That buffet is the best way to start the day. Room was very comfy, great bed, spacious, clean and with the private pool it was just the cherry on top. But what made our stay even better was the staff. The whole staff team was absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel. If we really want to find a couple of things to improve, then it would be: - a bit more maintainance of the pool mattresses and long chairs which are showing a bit of fatigue.- the price of the restaurants which is a bit high. ####[["It ' s right on the ocean", 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['got a gigantic swimming pool with a bar in it and tons of comfy mattresses and long chairs to chill', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The three restaurants on site are pretty good', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the breakfast definitely wins it all', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Room was very comfy , great bed , spacious , clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the private pool it was just the cherry on top', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['what made our stay even better was the staff', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The whole staff team was absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['a bit more maintainance of the pool mattresses and long chairs which are showing a bit of fatigue', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['the price of the restaurants which is a bit high', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['high', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

519,I really liked my stay at Lam Vien Homestay as it was quaint and really comfortable. I adored getting the chance to speak with owner and learn a little more about his and Hue's history. Plus, I arrived so early and they were more accomidating me as I rented a bike and joined one of the other travellers to journey together. My room was ideal, it was on the first floor and had easy access to the bathroom and privacy if wanted. Breakfast and other things were available though I didn't partake as IO have my own dietary means and wanted to see the city which is so full of history and excitement. I finally arrived late in the evening after consuming as much of the wonder that is Hue. I came back to what was supreme quiet and excellent accommodation as I prepared myself some food and go the comfort and quiet of a evening left to my own devices. Being close to both the north and south sides of Hue, I went off to explore as I would leave reasonably early the next morning and was delighted to be so well placed. I really recommend this incredible homestay and encourage you to stay as long as you can because there is so much that makes Hue ideal to travel and experience.

There is also almost no breakfast possibilities in the sourroundings exept pho or seafood. We booked a deluxe room in a (apparently) 4 star hotel, but the room we more like a good budget doubleroom. The queensize bed was cozy, but iz was not one double bed but 2 single beds next to each other. The room was only cleaned once during the stay of 4 days.

1999,A wonderful and peaceful oasis in the busy area of Cai Be. As we know the only place right on the river. We had a river view bungalow and it was really fantastic to watch all the life floating on the water. Staff and restaurant are not very professional due to lack of English language. But they are working hard and try to improve constantly. The pool and spa area are nice and the rooms are well equipped. Can't imagine to find a better place in the area. The private boat tour we booked was not worth it. There is no more floating market in Cai Be. So if you want to see dirty houses and trash go for ot. Better option is to ride the bike to town or on the island. ####[['A wonderful and peaceful oasis in the busy area of Cai Be', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We had a river view bungalow and it was really fantastic to watch all the life floating on the water', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Staff and restaurant are not very professional', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['lack of English language', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['But they are working hard and try to improve constantly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The pool and spa area are nice and the rooms are well equipped', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["Can ' t imagine to find a better place in the area", 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The private boat tour we booked was not worth it', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['There is no more floating market in Cai Be', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['So if you want to see dirty houses and trash go for ot', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Better option is to ride the bike to town or on the island', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

1558,Beautiful open see through lobby, lovely ocean view rooms with a balcony, superb breakfast buffet, wonderful staff and service, and a playroom for the kids with an attendant. The location is perfect, in the city but quieter when compared to the main road area. We ate at the restaurant several times, the seafood buffet was good, a la carte was really good too. The spa was lovely. We were very happy with our stay at Furama. It was great overall, we were very happy with our stay, difficult to find anything wrong. To note, for a family of 2 adults + 2 children, it would make sense to book an ocean view suite rather than take a garden view room. This is because when they say 2 twin beds, it means 2 single beds in the garden room which aren't useful for 2 adults and 2 kids. So you have to take an extra bed at an added cost. Hence for a similar price, take the ocean view room which come with 2 platform sofa's which can convert to 2 kids beds and a fantastic view!

1631,Breakfast was excellent, catering for eastern and western tastes. The open sided sunrise room was high up and gave beautiful views of the resort and the beach. Our room was very good, with a huge 8ft bed, everything was very clean. The beach was out of this world, wonderful. The hills, to leave the resort one was required to walk up a very steep hill for approximately 200/300 yards. We only did it once, never again. The temperature was 30°c plus. The resort has golf buggies which stand idle for much of the day, surely they could be used to ferry guests to the top and down again if necessary. The security man could easily be used and it would make his job a bit more fulfilling. Taxis are available and not expensive but it goes against the grain to pay for taxes every time you need to do little shopping. ####[['Breakfast was excellent , catering for eastern and western tastes', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The open sided sunrise room was high up and gave beautiful views of the resort and the beach', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our room was very good , with a huge 8ft bed , everything was very clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The beach was out of this world , wonderful', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hills , to leave the resort one was required to walk up a very steep hill for approximately 200 / 300 yards', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The temperature was 30 ° c plus', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The resort has golf buggies', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The security man could easily be used and it would make his job a bit more fulfilling', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Taxis are available and not expensive', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it goes against the grain to pay for taxes every time you need to do little shopping', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]
138802,This hotel is situated in a side street just off the main coast road. It took me 2 minutes to walk (stroll) to the beach. This is a very well maintained hotel.

There was always hot water available for the hand basin and shower There is also a lockable draw that I used without any concern or issue. Mrs Phoung, receptionist/director is pleasant and very helpful. The housekeeping staff were polite and considerate. There is no food available but closeby are restaurants, cafes and marts a plenty. The price is very reasonable for this quality of hotel. I highly recommend that you give this hotel your consideration. Not that it was in anyway a concern to me but guests should be aware that the smaller rooms do not have a view from the window.

We had to go to reception and ask where they were. Would be nice if there was some hiking(besides the walk up the stream) Only once we booked we found out that children are allowed at the resort.

139112,We purposely chose Sapa Clayhouse as the finale of our Vietnam trip and it was such a treat for us. We booked the executive suite. Everything inside the room was perfect. We went in mid December their winter season, and we were pleasantly surprised that the bed was heated. The decor and furnishings of the entire place were tastefully done up too, so pretty that we requested to buy some vases as souvenirs. The staffs were all very professional and polite. Food was really good too, everything we ordered was a hit. And try their signature house cocktail mix it was so good! Highly highly highly recommend to make this place your last stop in Sapa. We were a little shocked that the housekeeping team actually went into our room to clean up while we were at the dining area having our meal. It was a nice and attentive gesture but would appreciate the option for us to choose if we want the service or not, as for our personal preference, we prefer not to have housekeeping service during our stay to prevent any mishaps.

The house in itself is super convenient and if you go to the first floor you can have a wonderful view. There are many comfortable sits that allow you to take a nap while watching those famous rice fields. 2/ The owner, Emma, who can speak English, has been absolutely lovely with me ! She helped me in so many ways and made me feel at home which is a wonderful feeling when you are far away from your country. You can ask her to help you to plan your future destination (call a taxi, car etc….) which is super useful especially in Vietnam. 3/ Everything is super clean : the bathrooms, toilets, kitchen, rooms, beds etc so it feels like you are in a really nice hotel. 4/ The food was delicious so I recommend you to eat there from time to time (the breakfast (I have chosen pancakes) was really good and the cooker prepared the best tomato tofu of my life. ####[['This place looks like paradise on earth', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Moc Home is A Big house , with a pool , and a garden in the most beautiful mountains of Vietnam', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I was shocked about how beautiful the place was', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The owner , Emma , who can speak English , has been absolutely lovely with me !

1193,The Hanoi Paradise Centre Hotel & Spa was a quaint hotel located in the centre of Hanoi, walking distance from any of the lovely attractions that the city has to offer. The Hotel has a very nice staff who were welcoming and helpful. Most of all, we loved the breakfast! The hotel located in a very narrow lane and is easy to miss if you don't have a driver/guide. As the building is very narrow (most buildings in this area are narrow), the bathroom sink is placed within the bedroom, rather than the bathroom, making it slightly inconvenient. ####[['located in the centre of Hanoi', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The Hanoi Paradise Centre Hotel & Spa was a quaint hotel', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['walking distance from any of the lovely attractions that the city has to offer', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The Hotel has a very nice staff who were welcoming and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we loved the breakfast', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["The hotel located in a very narrow lane and is easy to miss if you don ' t have a driver / guide", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the bathroom sink is placed within the bedroom , rather than the bathroom , making it slightly inconvenient', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

She offered me really bad exchange rate (quite worse then the one I got at Intecontinental a day before) and once more confirmed I can not exchange it outside. After that (lie) i went out and after 1min walk saw that there are many touristic small agencies where you can exchange money with quite better rate.

We shared more than one bottle and on the next day I was feeling good - so no hangover at all!)

I really loved the window. The location itself is really beautiful!I would highly recommend to sit there close to the River and watch the Moon rise.

The best pineapple juice we've ever had. Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast. - The room was huge, well thought out and as ascetically pleasing. - The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and "cute" at night - Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround. - The beach is a minutes walk away and surprisingly nice and clean. - Good number of affordable bars and restaurants (we went to Mr Hoà's Kitchen and The Tamarinde Tree, Baby Mustard) - Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies, local area. Or to cycle to Hoi An old town, busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly. - Can get a grab from the end of the road in to Hoi An old town for about 75k VND (10 minute journey), we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening. - The hotel is small and therefore the pool is, if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves - It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren't aware. - Bikes could do with some maintenance, oil, tyres, new bell etc - but this seems to be a theme in Vietnam :) ####[['Tanya was a exceptional host , very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast was super , a good selection of fresh items that are pre - ordered the evening before', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["The best pineapple juice we ' ve ever had", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room was huge , well thought out and as ascetically pleasing', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and " cute " at nigh', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The beach is a minutes walk away', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['surprisingly nice and clean', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Good number of affordable bars and restaurants', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies , local area', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['to cycle to Hoi An old town , busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The hotel is small and therefore the pool is', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ["It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren ' t aware", 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Bikes could do with some maintenance , oil , tyres , new bell', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

Apparently, it's very popular. It's full in the evenings. No surprise, because the food is cheap, good and served in a beautiful way. It's all located in a small alley so usually it's very quiet.

182,The facilities of the apartment are great. Brand new building. The studio I stayed has everything I needed except the hairdryer didn’t work. The swimming pool was stunning. The organisation and communication was poor!! I requested a double bed but I had twin room. I’m the person who can’t sleep on a tiny bed. I realised that I made booking with an individual owner, not with the hotel which means any issue you have to deal directly with the owner, not the hotel staff. The staff from the owner came without notice, ring the bell and ask to pay the bill. She admitted her mistake of not providing a double bed and reduced the payment. regardless I couldn’t sleep. This room includes breakfast but be aware that it’s not hotel breakfast!!!! They take you to a local eatery for breakfast. The owner poorly communicates so the restaurant staff asked me to pay for the meal. After a looooooooooong and frustrating conversations between hotel management, owner and restaurant staff, you will be told by the owner “I will pay”. That’s it. He just hang off the phone!!!

1408,The location of this hostel is good, about a 10 minute motorbike ride from the beach and there are some lovely local bars, restaurants and tailors in the surrounding area as well. The staff were pleasant and friendly, with good recommendations and great English skills. They switched us to a different room quickly and without a hassle when my friend and I didn't want to share our hostel room with loud guests. This hostel is very dominated by English backpackers and so it caters to a very party/drinking oriented crowd, so if this is not what you're looking for this is probably not the place for you. While the pool is a nice addition, it's rather small. The breakfast provided was really lacking variety though, and what they did have was not very nice.

105,My family and I had a very comfortable stay at Hanoi Silk Centre hotel. The location is great. It’s in the centre of the old quarter but it’s peaceful and quiet inside. The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place. All the staff are so friendly, especially Ms Karathy and Jay. Ms Karathy booked our transfer from the airport, our trip to Ha Long Bay and was so helpful in making sure everything was sorted before we arrived. Jay made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to help us out. The day of our check out, the staff kindly allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel for the entire day until evening, when we picked up our bags to catch our overnight train to Hue. My dad accidentally left his medication in the hotel room and only realised when we got to the train station.

422,I’ve waited to review our stay because I need to do it justice and today I have the time to say how we felt about our time there. The staff are just incredible. Nothing is too much trouble. We felt so comfortable we didn’t want to leave. In fact we cried as we left and everyone waved us off. Once home we asked each other which was our favourite place we stayed in the 18 days from Saigon to Hanoi and everything in-between. We all agreed Hoi An Odyssey was the classiest, cleanest, friendliest, best located hotel we stayed at. Just outside the town, and easily walkable with a perfect pool and lovely food, our room was beyond beautiful and again, the staff were the absolute icing on the cake. Too many to name but each of them remembered!

139362,Loved the value for money. To have your own room in district one not more than 10 min walk from walking street and the busy bar and restaurant area is super for the price. In a authentic Vietnamese alley and market street locale. Room was a good size. Air conditioning worked well and a nice bathroom. Good work space and table with chairs. View of the city. It's probably a 2 star equivalent in Europe with a 3 or 4 star shower. Would suit a long stay. Like a month to really emmerse in the city or if you had studies to do. Would recommend this hostel/hotel. They take visa and card payments which is great option. Like most things really at this price point. But only thing really was the door to my room number 5 on 4th floor, was a little battered and slight cracks and gaps could be seen. But it did lock! The other doors seemed in better shape. Thinking they could replace or repair this one. ####[['Loved the value for money', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['To have your own room in district one not more than 10 min walk from walking street and the busy bar and restaurant area is super for the price', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Room was a good size', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Air conditioning worked well and a nice bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Good work space and table with chairs', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['View of the city', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["It ' s probably a 2 star equivalent in Europe with a 3 or 4 star shower", 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Would recommend this hostel / hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They take visa and card payments which is great option', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['But only thing really was the door to my room number 5 on 4th floor , was a little battered and slight cracks and gaps could be seen', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

140206,Halong Bay is a must when you travel to Vietnam, and there are many options out there. We did a lot of research on the number of days to stay on the boat and also, which company to use. We opted for Le Theatre cruise 2 days 1 Night (2D1N), because of the itinerary and the activities. The boat itself is very luxurious and you feel like a star when the crew welcomes you on board. The cruise was not busy and so we had the chance to be upgraded to their best suite, for free! Views were absolutely incredible from that room. The food in the evening is also good, attention to the details was appreciated. Highly recommend this company, as it is one of our highlights of our trip.

831,Pool area was really nice, rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable. I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer. Staff very friendly. After ordering a sandwich the bar tender took my payment card away to reception, I presumed to bring a card machine or to swipe my card at reception. There was some misunderstanding and I thought he was asking for my room number but sometime later I got a failed chip and pin attempt notification, he had exceeded the amount of pin attempts and my card was permanently blocked! After several correspondence with my bank about how to unblock it I found out that: The card can only be unblocked in the U. K. For the rest of the trip I was unable to use my card!He probably was trying to provide extra service and be helpful, or maybe it is a cultural difference but in the U. K. no one would ever give their PIN number to someone else, especially a staff member or stranger so we would never even suspect that a member of hotel staff was asking for a PIN number and not a room number. I was annoyed to say the least and even asked them to remove the service charge. At the end they still kept the charge on and I even added somesmall tip because felt bad for the guy who made a mistake, he did also give me a complimentary cola. Though if this happened in Europe at a luxury hotel or resort the sandwich would have lest been complimented in full. Be very careful and never let anyone walk away with your card!

139164,The room was fine. Nothing overwhelming. Small bathroom incl. a shower (not seperated) underneath the starecase. So definitely nothing for tall people. The homestay is very close to the beach and has a very nice design as advertised in the pictures although a little worn down in the room itself. In my case I didn't have a window - only one to the hall way. The owner is not living at the same place so I had to wait to get instructions about the key code etc. However, that also made it very easy to check-in and out. Overall, good value for your money and would stay another time, maybe in a bigger room (that was sold out at that time) There were quite a lot of (old) spider webs in my rooms.

1621,The property is beautiful, in an extremely peaceful area. Even though it was winter while we were there, the pool looked gorgeous and we gave the private plunge pool a go too! The food from the restaurant was lovely, and we had all our meals there. The wine list is also excellent! By far the most exceptional part of the experience was the staff, who went above and beyond to make our stay special. They even surprised me with a birthday cake and sang happy birthday to me at dinner! And they also decorated our room with rose petals and a hand-written card. So special! The only (small) issue we had was in trying to use the wooden bath. It’s BEAUTIFUL but extremely difficult to fill unless you want a pretty cold bath. The hot water runs out too quickly to fill it. Otherwise, our stay was spectacular! ####[['The property is beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['in an extremely peaceful area', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the pool looked gorgeous', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we gave the private plunge pool a go', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The food from the restaurant was lovely , and we had all our meals there', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The wine list is also excellent', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['By far the most exceptional part of the experience was the staff , who went above and beyond to make our stay special', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They even surprised me with a birthday cake and sang happy birthday to me at dinner', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['And they also decorated our room with rose petals and a hand - written card', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['It ’ s BEAUTIFUL', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['extremely difficult to fill unless you want a pretty cold bath', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The hot water runs out too quickly to fill it', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['our stay was spectacular', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['issue we had was in trying to use the wooden bath', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

1407,The boat itself is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay. It feels magical. The staff were extremely kind and welcoming. We did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized. Kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in Vietnam. All the food was quite good and was included. But, FYI if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise. The staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood. The baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window, so you can look out at the bay, which is great. This ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay. The balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures. No drinks are included and although they have a buy 2 get 1 free happy hour, the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying it would be nice if they were included. On the last day as well we went on the tour to the caves on the bamboo boats, which was great to see. However, there was very little time after the tour before checkout to shower or pack and it felt quite rushed. ####[['The boat itself is absolutely beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['It feels magical', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The staff were extremely kind and welcoming', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in Vietnam', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['All the food was quite good and was included', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['you can look out at the bay , which is great', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['This ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['No drinks are included', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['it would be nice if they were included', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['On the last day as well we went on the tour to the caves on the bamboo boats , which was great to see .', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['there was very little time after the tour before checkout to shower or pack and it felt quite rushed', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]
138594,The hotel itself and the staff deserve a five star rating. The facilities of the hotel, the interior design, the standard of the rooms are high class. There is absolutely nothing missing to enjoy a wonderful stay. The Spa is well equipped, offers a great variety of treatments by experienced, well trained therapists. The restaurant on the basement floor offers a huge breakfast buffet, western and Asian style plus a menue. Lunch and dinner has separate menue with various dishes at reasonable prices. Service is attentive and especially at breakfast there is no request they wouldn't satisfy. Even for breakfast they ask for your allergies! There is a rooftop bar with happy hour and a view from the 5th floor. The other bar is in the lobby. My room offered much more than I expected: apart from safe, TV, hairdryer and water kettle, there is a fridge, free water, tea, coffee and fruits. The bed is so comfortable you don't want to get out, as is the linen and towels from very good quality. Enough plugs to recharge your electronic equipment. Lights are also good and enough. Bathroom with all amenities. Of course there is an elevator in the house. The location is great. The staff speaks good English and is more than helpful in any way. I rate 5 Stars hotel but cosy and very personal.

1580,The room was comfortable and clean, and the pool was very nice (apart from the rubbish at the bottom). It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi’s are available to get into town. The cleaning staff were very friendly. The staff weren’t helpful - there is a clear lack of management. The pool bar wait times are ridiculous, 1. 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water, 1. 5 for food as well. On our first 2 days the wait wasn’t as bad but there was only one person, the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long. The food and drink is also very overpriced (western prices) and very average. The laundry service is ridiculously expensive, we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear! There is no local advice available from the staff. We weren’t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren’t offered the welcome drink they advertise. Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment. The breakfast is constantly running out, and even if all the food and drink is available, there are no cups or plates to use! The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover, there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it. Overall, this is a 3 star experience, but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it’s a good option. ####[['The room was comfortable and clean , and the pool was very nice', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi ’ s are available to get into town', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The cleaning staff were very friendly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The staff weren ’ t helpful - there is a clear lack of management', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The pool bar wait times are ridiculous', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['1 . 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water , 1 . 5 for food as well', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['On our first 2 days the wait wasn ’ t as bad but there was only one person , the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The laundry service is ridiculously expensive , we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The food and drink is also very overpriced', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['and very average', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['There is no local advice available from the staff', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We weren ’ t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren ’ t offered the welcome drink they advertise', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The breakfast is constantly running out , and even if all the food and drink is available , there are no cups or plates to use', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover , there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['this is a 3 star experience , but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it ’ s a good option', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

Staff were lovely and friendly, brand new and can tell this place will do well!

1294,We stayed at Golden Holiday for a few days, in a total of 3 rooms. I'm going to give you lots of details about our stay, so you can see if it is right for you. Short story - we really enjoyed it!First the rooms - rooms are quite large, with very nice sheets, towels, pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers. We're not talking super high-end, but for the price the rooms are great. Some rooms have a small sofa - ask if your room has one, or request one. Wi-fi worked great> Toilets worked well, with nice bidets attached. If you want a large, comfortable room - I don't think you can go wrong here. Staff - staff are great. This place is well staffed, there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk, always willing to go out of their way for you. Especially Thuy and Ms. Kim - they are fantastic and will help make your stay very enjoyable. They often called "electric shuttles" for us, which worked well for transporting 5 people from 1 - 3km away. Breakfast - there is a large breakfast buffet available every day from 7 to 10AM. Ours was included in the room rates. There was great coffee, also fruits, salads, asian, and some western items. Some days there were bacon and chocolate crossaints. You could always get eggs cooked anyway you liked. No pancakes or waffles, but I don't think these are very common in Vietnam. It was easy to grab some pastries to go from the breakfast buffet so you had some snacks for later on. Pool - there was a medium sized pool outside. It was nice, clean - not super huge but large enough to do laps in it. Location - it is located right on a semi-busy street, but we never heard noise from our rooms, as it is set back a bit from the road. There are plenty of spas and restaurants in the area - but you are outside of the super busy, noisy "old town" tourist area. It is a quick 5 min electric shuttle ride ($2 usd) or a 22 minute walk to the main "old town" walking areas. ####[['we really enjoyed it', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['rooms are quite large , with very nice sheets , towels , pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["We ' re not talking super high - end , but for the price the rooms are great", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Some rooms have a small sofa', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Wi - fi worked great', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Toilets worked well , with nice bidets attached', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['staff are great', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['This place is well staffed , there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk , always willing to go out of their way for you .

1010,I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential. With its prime location opposite the beach, attentive staff, and impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products, my overall experience was positive. While the hotel showed promise in many aspects, the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay. I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel's recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time. It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences. However, considering the hotel had only been operational for two weeks, this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy. ####[['I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['its prime location opposite the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['attentive staff', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products , my overall experience was positive', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel ' s recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

138879,It really was a great hideaway and base for exploring Ben Tre. It is located on the quieter side of the river and way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel. The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area. The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more. The homestay itself is cute and homely, with a small shared living space that you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions. The rooms are located just behind a little stream at the back and provides total quietness. Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them! We stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view. Internet is great and we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us. It was such a lovely place to get away from HCMC for a few days. It is a great value for price! The only inconvenience (that can be easily rectified) is that as it is in the outskirt of Ben Tre you cannot reach there by public transport from HCMC. The small taxi rides are absolutely worth being in the quietness and lush green surroundings! ####[['It is located on the quieter side of the river', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The homestay itself is cute and homely , with a small shared living space', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them !

During our days there, I got pretty sick one day and I did not feel well at all. Two of your wonderful employees took special care of me until I was feeling better.

138475,They were all very nice, and the hotel is really central. We arrived late at night, so we asked for a transfer from the airport. The lady was very nice to us, but we realised that we would pay 400. 000 vd, which is a lot for this transfer from the airport. (If we had gone by taxi, we would pay only around 130. 000 vd...) When we got to the hotel, a really nice man was there to receive us. The small room that we booked had no windows, so we upgraded to the bigger room. The hotel is OK, not fancy (we have to watch out for the cockroachs), but it's really central, and we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night, and also the air-conditioning machine outside (which is normal in Vietnam). When we were leaving, we asked the man if he could please call a taxi, and we expected no more fees from the hotel. Until we realised that the lady came to collect our money, saying that her car would take us to the airport (for 220. 000 vd). Of course, it was not her car, and she paid the taxi and got a fee from our money. We're not sure how much she paid the taxi, but it should be around 120. 000 vd, and the rest of the 100. 000 vd went to her pocket. It wasn't correct of her, and we felt robbed. I'd definitely not recommend this hotel, and if you do stay there, ALWAYS GET A TAXI YOURSELF, or give the extra money to the person that actually drives you.. ####[['They were all very nice', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the hotel is really central', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The lady was very nice to us', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['but we realised that we would pay 400 . 000 vd , which is a lot for this transfer from the airport', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['When we got to the hotel , a really nice man was there to receive us', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The small room that we booked had no windows , so we upgraded to the bigger room', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hotel is OK , not fancy', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night , and also the air - conditioning machine outside', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['we realised that the lady came to collect our money , saying that her car would take us to the airport ( for 220 . 000 vd ).

The property offers several breakfast options including eggs, pancakes or yogurt and fruit. They also do dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed a menu of chicken stir-fry, shrimp stir-fry and spring rolls at the property. Much better quality than the dinner we had in Sapa. But the gem is the gardens surrounding the property, they are absolutely stunning. There are several sitting areas to enjoy a glass of wine in the evening. In addition the staff is very helpful and accommodating. Mr. Nam Hong can arrange a guide for treks in the area and tickets for Fansipan mountain. Laundry service is also available.

The room I stayed in had no window, so it was quite stuffy, but that was expected for the price. I peeped into a renovated higher end room on that floor (the door was open because of the construction), and it looked pretty good. The fridge didn't work (no cooling effect whatsoever) and the little bottles of shower gel and shampoo in the shower seemed to all be missing the little straws inside so you cannot really use the pump on it, which was weird?!The landromat was expensive: 120. 000vnd (or more) for a load of clothes.

421,Incredibly comfortable bed. Great location. Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements. Preface: Their claim is "Beyond Perfection" and it is marketed as a "Luxury Boutique" 5 star hotel. While beautifully designed, many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience (function of light switches, relative position of shower and towel for maximum water coverage of said towels, maintenance work during check-out hours) and some elements already are showing wear and tear. For a 5 star hotel, the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training, with very odd formalities that were unnecessary, poorly executed, or just awkward. We also received a phone call to our room at 4:48am, which was a mistake by reception. When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves. (The manager did reimbursed us for transport when it was brought to her attention) The cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed. Known classics were watered down and almost unrecognisable in their taste. ####[['Incredibly comfortable bed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Great location', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['beautifully designed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['some elements already are showing wear and tear', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['For a 5 star hotel , the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training , with very odd formalities that were unnecessary , poorly executed , or just awkward', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We also received a phone call to our room at 4 : 48am , which was a mistake by reception', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Known classics were watered down and almost unrecognisable in their taste', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

Our room was also very beautiful and clean. We loved the balcony where we could take in the views. The hotel is incredibly beautiful and the grounds are well maintained. There are flowers and plants everywhere which just add an extra layer to the place. The staff were also very helpful in arranging taxis into Sapa and Cat Cat Village. Since the bungalows are quite close together, there were a few guests who were incredibly loud which disturbed our sleep. The hotel manager apologised for this incident the next morning which was appreciated. Breakfast could be improved. We mainly ate eggs, but the offering could be a bit more diverse. ####[['The view from our room was amazing', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we opened our curtains to find the most amazing view of the surrounding landscape .

139569,We arrived late to this charming hotel, check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade. Our room was well appointed, just as pictured in the photos with a very comfortable bed. In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields. Both the ladies at reception, Xí and Vân, took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind. From helping us book taxis, tours (we booked Golden Bridge), laundry services, massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning, they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional. They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight! This hotel is located halfway between An Bang Beach and Hoi An Old Town, in a peaceful, tranquil rural setting. It’s ideally situated for day trips like basket boat tours and even Tra Que Culinary Village. We loved being able to see the farmers work the land in this authentic setting and walking to nearby little cafés. We used the free bicycles to explore the area a few times, which was very pleasant. It would be a quick 10-15 minute bike ride into town. The pool was a little too cold for us during our one week stay in February, but it was still lovely to sit around on the comfy loungers and listen to the trickling water, like a little oasis. The gentleman who works on the grounds doesn’t speak English, but he works very hard to maintain the property, is the hotel’s security, gardener and I’m sure whatever else needs doing. Our hats off to him! We Canadians highly recommend this little gem of a hotel just outside the busy area. We’d like to thank the staff at Maison Fleur Hoi An for a wonderful stay! Occasionally we had to be patient to get a Grab taxi to come and pick us up at the property as it's a little out of the way. But this is also part of why we liked the hotel. ####[['check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our room was well appointed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['just as pictured in the photos', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Both the ladies at reception , Xí and Vân , took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['From helping us book taxis , tours ( we booked Golden Bridge ), laundry services , massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning , they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight !

138857,Beautiful view, comfy room and affordable price. We paid for an early check-in and we were given the wrong room. We then had to wait over 3 hours for the correct room. Couldn't be bothered changing rooms at that point as we were on our way out for the day. The breakfast buffet had 0 vegetarian options. There was no light in the bathroom.

1478,The pool is really gorgeous. We spent every afternoon relaxing, reading and swimming there. Loved our little bungalow with the beautiful bathroom. Very peaceful, beautiful resort and nice to watch the world go by on the river. We cycled into the town to eat seafood and pizza (both recommended and cheap!) and cycled to the island in the middle using bikes provided by the hotel for free. We came over the new year holiday and the resort hired lion dancers to come and dance and play drums from 7:20am to 8:20am two mornings in a row. Would have really preferred to see them in the evening as it was SUPER loud and didn't make for a peaceful wakeup. ####[['The pool is really gorgeous', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We spent every afternoon relaxing , reading and swimming there', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Loved our little bungalow with the beautiful bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Very peaceful , beautiful resort and nice to watch the world go by on the river', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We cycled into the town to eat seafood and pizza', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['cycled to the island in the middle', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['using bikes provided by the hotel for free', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["Would have really preferred to see them in the evening as it was SUPER loud and didn ' t make for a peaceful wakeup", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

1948,When we arrived we were greeted in a super friendly manner by Lucy. She showed us on there own created map what to do in Hoi An, like where to eat and which activities we can do. The room was clean and comfortable. They have everything what you need, especially they had a lot of shampoos. The pool was very nice and we had a balcony. The location is the best for walking in the town, but it's also not far to the beach with a bicycle. The hotel has a lot of charm which fits perfectly to Hoi an. If we had more time we would have stayed longer. Even after we checked out Lucy helped us with everything.

1991,The rooms are very well designed! Beds are very comfortable. The rooftop infinity pool is just awesome and you can also get draft beer delivered there. The elevators are just a mess there. They only have four for I think 27 levels and one of them wasn’t working. Sometimes it took ten minutes until an elevator arrived. Breakfast is good but they only serve it from six to nine. And especially from eight to nine it is extremely crowded. The food in the in-room dining menu was only okay. From a five star hotel I expect much better food. What was also really annoying that you can’t charge anything to your room. You always have to pay at the spot (this includes drinks ordered from the pool, which you can imagine is quite challenging!). ####[['The rooms are very well designed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Beds are very comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The rooftop infinity pool is just awesome', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['you can also get draft beer delivered there', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The elevators are just a mess there', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['They only have four for I think 27 levels and one of them wasn ’ t working', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Sometimes it took ten minutes until an elevator arrived', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast is good but they only serve it from six to nine', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['And especially from eight to nine it is extremely crowded', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The food in the in - room dining menu was only okay', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['From a five star hotel I expect much better food', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['What was also really annoying that you can ’ t charge anything to your room', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['You always have to pay at the spot', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL']]
