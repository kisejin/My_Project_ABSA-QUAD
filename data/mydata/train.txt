140215,Bed soft, cleaning room and shower was great, strong water. room have enough equipment to use after shower. Staff help a lot and friendly. Staff inform me about breakfast but did not mention about what kind of breakfast and when i went up 7th floor at 8h30 there was no breakfast. A group of kids came and stay very noise, so if somebody outside or next room and they move things you will hear them quite clearly. i had should ask reception to tell the kids. Room have small window but without curtain so no nap time in the day. ####[['Bed soft , cleaning room and shower was great , strong water', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['room have enough equipment to use after shower', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Staff help a lot and friendly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Staff inform me about breakfast but did not mention about what kind of breakfast and when i went up 7th floor at 8h30 there was no breakfast', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['A group of kids came and stay very noise', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Room have small window but without curtain so no nap time in the day', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

139512,The room is comfortable, has all the basic amenities with stable, fast wifi connection. Breakfast is good too and we especially enjoyed local food options. Location is great with a 5-8 min walk to the old town. What really stands out is the amazing service and hospitality provided by the hotel! They gave good advice/tips on Hoi An, helped to arrange competitively priced tours and even helped to buy local delicacies to bring back home - it's like having a personal concierge! I definitely recommend Sq Villa to everyone. ####[['The room is comfortable , has all the basic amenities with stable , fast wifi connection', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast is good too and we especially enjoyed local food options', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Location is great with a 5 - 8 min walk to the old town', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['What really stands out is the amazing service and hospitality provided by the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They gave good advice / tips on Hoi An , helped to arrange competitively priced tours and even helped to buy local delicacies to bring back home', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I definitely recommend Sq Villa to everyone', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

52,The hotel itself is quite a nice looking building. It's in Da Nang, and the staff are pretty nice! The shower is big and the water pressure is good. Decent place to work as well, because of the good Wi Fi. The price was amazing. Really incredibly cheap for what you get. The bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet, there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed, the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area. I'm not sure if it was a residential building as well, but there was a family staying on our floor that had two rooms, and left the door open between them, yelling very loudly in the hallway at all hours. Overall it was just not relaxing or comfortable. I can't hold anything against the staff, but my experience here was dreadful. I'm sorry. But I do hope my feedback goes somewhere, since there are positive aspects to the hotel too. ####[['the staff are pretty nice', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The shower is big and the water pressure is good', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Decent place to work as well , because of the good Wi Fi', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hotel itself is quite a nice looking building', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The price was amazing', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Really incredibly cheap for what you get', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet , there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Overall it was just not relaxing or comfortable', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['my experience here was dreadful', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["I can ' t hold anything against the staff", 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['since there are positive aspects to the hotel too', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["I ' m not sure if it was a residential building as well , but there was a family staying on our floor that had two rooms , and left the door open between them , yelling very loudly in the hallway at all hours", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

1232,Our room was great- large, all wood, with a balcony facing the valley and a hot tub in the bathroom. Staff were super friendly and helpful. It was a positive that the lodge was out of the city of Sa Pa, giving us lots of peace and quiet. The lodge restaurant served a wide variety of dishes and the quality was very good. It's a bit costly to get from the hotel to the town of Sa Pa - about $9 each way in taxi and although the lodge has a good view of the valley, it is built right on a main road. Can't say enough about how friendly and helpful staff were, but the level of English was often poor, and thus getting answers to questions about sites to visit, places to go, and things to do, were often confusing and contradictory. ####[['Our room was great - large , all wood , with a balcony facing the valley and a hot tub in the bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Staff were super friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['It was a positive that the lodge was out of the city of Sa Pa , giving us lots of peace and quiet', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The lodge restaurant served a wide variety of dishes and the quality was very good', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["It ' s a bit costly to get from the hotel to the town of Sa Pa - about $ 9 each way in taxi", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the lodge has a good view of the valley', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it is built right on a main road', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["Can ' t say enough about how friendly and helpful staff were", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['but the level of English was often poor', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['and thus getting answers to questions about sites to visit , places to go , and things to do , were often confusing and contradictory', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

1294,We stayed at Golden Holiday for a few days, in a total of 3 rooms. I'm going to give you lots of details about our stay, so you can see if it is right for you. Short story - we really enjoyed it!First the rooms - rooms are quite large, with very nice sheets, towels, pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers. We're not talking super high-end, but for the price the rooms are great. Some rooms have a small sofa - ask if your room has one, or request one. Wi-fi worked great> Toilets worked well, with nice bidets attached. If you want a large, comfortable room - I don't think you can go wrong here. Staff - staff are great. This place is well staffed, there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk, always willing to go out of their way for you. Especially Thuy and Ms. Kim - they are fantastic and will help make your stay very enjoyable. They often called "electric shuttles" for us, which worked well for transporting 5 people from 1 - 3km away. Breakfast - there is a large breakfast buffet available every day from 7 to 10AM. Ours was included in the room rates. There was great coffee, also fruits, salads, asian, and some western items. Some days there were bacon and chocolate crossaints. You could always get eggs cooked anyway you liked. No pancakes or waffles, but I don't think these are very common in Vietnam. It was easy to grab some pastries to go from the breakfast buffet so you had some snacks for later on. Pool - there was a medium sized pool outside. It was nice, clean - not super huge but large enough to do laps in it. Location - it is located right on a semi-busy street, but we never heard noise from our rooms, as it is set back a bit from the road. There are plenty of spas and restaurants in the area - but you are outside of the super busy, noisy "old town" tourist area. It is a quick 5 min electric shuttle ride ($2 usd) or a 22 minute walk to the main "old town" walking areas. ####[['we really enjoyed it', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['rooms are quite large , with very nice sheets , towels , pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["We ' re not talking super high - end , but for the price the rooms are great", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Some rooms have a small sofa', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Wi - fi worked great', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Toilets worked well , with nice bidets attached', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['staff are great', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['This place is well staffed , there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk , always willing to go out of their way for you .

Secondly is the house keepers were too stingy , I was staying five days four night , they didn’t even give me extra hand soap , only one soap used for five days . Even my room slippers had wet they just ignored and didn’t put an extra in the cupboard.

140102,Staff were friendly, helpful, polite. We ended up booking Hà Long Bay tour, Sapa trekking tour, and Nimh Binh with them for the convenience and price. Good advice would be to not book too early and check the weather...better to go sooner while the weather is tame than to be pushed for time and have to cancel some things. Luckily for us, we had time. The location is great and we used this hotel as a base as we did 1-3 day trips around Hanoi. They were great with communication and super accommodating. Highly recommend as a good accomodation for the cost. Hotel construction started at 7:30-11am and we weren't warnded/informed. They were very apologetic about it and we are totally understanding as they have to do it at some point. It would just be considerate to let guests know beforehand (and I have given this same feedback on their checkout form).Still, the room is nice and I would come back to stay here! Thank you to the amazing staff! ####[['Staff were friendly , helpful , polite', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Good advice would be to not book too early and check the weather ... better to go sooner while the weather is tame than to be pushed for time and have to cancel some things', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The location is great and we used this hotel as a base as we did 1 - 3 day trips around Hanoi', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They were great with communication and super accommodating', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Highly recommend as a good accomodation for the cost', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["Hotel construction started at 7 : 30 - 11am and we weren ' t warnded / informed", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['They were very apologetic about it and we are totally understanding as they have to do it at some point', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['the room is nice', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I would come back to stay here', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Thank you to the amazing staff', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

The private rooms are still at great prices, and come with a kettle, sink, and private bathroom. And the renter can control the air conditioner. I rate the private room at an 8 because it is more like a normal hotel room, but at 1/3 the cost of a cheap hotel. In the group rooms, the air conditioner is only turned on from 9pm to 7am, so the room is too hot to be in during the daytime.

139569,We arrived late to this charming hotel, check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade. Our room was well appointed, just as pictured in the photos with a very comfortable bed. In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields. Both the ladies at reception, Xí and Vân, took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind. From helping us book taxis, tours (we booked Golden Bridge), laundry services, massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning, they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional. They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight! This hotel is located halfway between An Bang Beach and Hoi An Old Town, in a peaceful, tranquil rural setting. It’s ideally situated for day trips like basket boat tours and even Tra Que Culinary Village. We loved being able to see the farmers work the land in this authentic setting and walking to nearby little cafés. We used the free bicycles to explore the area a few times, which was very pleasant. It would be a quick 10-15 minute bike ride into town. The pool was a little too cold for us during our one week stay in February, but it was still lovely to sit around on the comfy loungers and listen to the trickling water, like a little oasis.

Also, on booking. com the address is wrong (correct address as of 4/23 is Alley 1/5A, Đường Lê Hồng Phong, Phường 4, Thành phố Đà Lạt, Lâm Đồng, Vietnam) which meant that I showed up to the old hostel address at 4:30 in the morning.

138475,They were all very nice, and the hotel is really central. We arrived late at night, so we asked for a transfer from the airport. The lady was very nice to us, but we realised that we would pay 400. 000 vd, which is a lot for this transfer from the airport. (If we had gone by taxi, we would pay only around 130. 000 vd...) When we got to the hotel, a really nice man was there to receive us. The small room that we booked had no windows, so we upgraded to the bigger room. The hotel is OK, not fancy (we have to watch out for the cockroachs), but it's really central, and we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night, and also the air-conditioning machine outside (which is normal in Vietnam). When we were leaving, we asked the man if he could please call a taxi, and we expected no more fees from the hotel. Until we realised that the lady came to collect our money, saying that her car would take us to the airport (for 220. 000 vd). Of course, it was not her car, and she paid the taxi and got a fee from our money. We're not sure how much she paid the taxi, but it should be around 120. 000 vd, and the rest of the 100. 000 vd went to her pocket. It wasn't correct of her, and we felt robbed. I'd definitely not recommend this hotel, and if you do stay there, ALWAYS GET A TAXI YOURSELF, or give the extra money to the person that actually drives you.. ####[['They were all very nice', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the hotel is really central', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The lady was very nice to us', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['but we realised that we would pay 400 . 000 vd , which is a lot for this transfer from the airport', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['When we got to the hotel , a really nice man was there to receive us', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The small room that we booked had no windows , so we upgraded to the bigger room', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hotel is OK , not fancy', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night , and also the air - conditioning machine outside', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['we realised that the lady came to collect our money , saying that her car would take us to the airport ( for 220 . 000 vd ).

1163,- Tanya was a exceptional host, very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay. - Breakfast was super, a good selection of fresh items that are pre-ordered the evening before. The best pineapple juice we've ever had. Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast. - The room was huge, well thought out and as ascetically pleasing. - The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and "cute" at night - Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround. - The beach is a minutes walk away and surprisingly nice and clean. - Good number of affordable bars and restaurants (we went to Mr Hoà's Kitchen and The Tamarinde Tree, Baby Mustard) - Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies, local area. Or to cycle to Hoi An old town, busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly. - Can get a grab from the end of the road in to Hoi An old town for about 75k VND (10 minute journey), we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening. - The hotel is small and therefore the pool is, if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves - It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren't aware. - Bikes could do with some maintenance, oil, tyres, new bell etc - but this seems to be a theme in Vietnam :) ####[['Tanya was a exceptional host , very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast was super , a good selection of fresh items that are pre - ordered the evening before', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["The best pineapple juice we ' ve ever had", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room was huge , well thought out and as ascetically pleasing', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and " cute " at nigh', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The beach is a minutes walk away', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['surprisingly nice and clean', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Good number of affordable bars and restaurants', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies , local area', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['to cycle to Hoi An old town , busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The hotel is small and therefore the pool is', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ["It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren ' t aware", 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Bikes could do with some maintenance , oil , tyres , new bell', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

138544,This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it's very near the Lake, the cute little streets, restaurants, night market, you name it. When you enter the hotel, you notice that the narrow entrance - which is normal for all hotels and houses in Hanoi - opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours, furniture and benches, and the most welcoming staff. Will, the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived, explained everything about the hotel and Hanoi as if he was a tour-guide, and he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits. Will is not the only gem in this hotel, as other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness, which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect. The hotel has a lift, a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby, the rooms have great beds (thank you) and a good lay-out for the space in an inner city hotel. It also has a lovely breakfast place (beautiful decoration) with good choices of food and drinks, and again great staff. However, one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the Skybar and roomservice is the best we had in Hanoi - by far. So we hope they create an inviting restaurant or rooftop eatery that creates a place for the chef to display her/his talents. Other good things to write about are the Spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff, and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place. Vietnam is colourful, and this is reflected in the interior design. We saw tourists stay here, as well as business people and locals, so we felt right at home. The hotel could possibly offer water refill-locations so less plastic is used, but it seems that Vietnam should tackle that problem in more hotels and locations. ####[["This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it ' s very near the Lake", 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours , furniture and benches', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['and the most welcoming staff .

1945,The location is good with many amenities nearby, however not suitable for travellers with private car as there is no car parking. The apartment image as shown on booking. com is just for reference. If you are lucky you can get an apartment on high floor which give you a nice sea view (as shown on the picture and is a decision making driver for me).

139786,Large room with huge bed. Mattresses are very firm as is common across SE Asia. Air conditioner so no problems staying cool when needed. Beach area is small but with great sand and is full of small fish/crabs/etc to explore. The resort is extremely quiet, which is what we were looking for. Staff was very friendly and extremely helpful in getting bookings with John's tours, scooter rental, airport shuttles, and we extended our trip 2 days. They even assisted guests who ran low on gas due to gas stations closing early for Tet. Be aware that the walls are paper thin so you will hear anything happening next door - as it was a slow period we were the only ones for most of our stay and only heard neighbors a few times. If you are planning to explore the south, it's a bit of a commute, but the whole island s small enough that it's no problem if you are comfortable with scooters. ####[['Large room with huge bed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Mattresses are very firm as is common across SE Asia', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Air conditioner so no problems staying cool when needed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Beach area is small but with great sand and is full of small fish / crabs / etc to explore', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The resort is extremely quiet , which is what we were looking for', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["Staff was very friendly and extremely helpful in getting bookings with John ' s tours , scooter rental , airport shuttles , and we extended our trip 2 days", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They even assisted guests who ran low on gas due to gas stations closing early for Te', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Be aware that the walls are paper thin so you will hear anything happening next door', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

890,The staff at the Solaria Hotel were absolutely wonderful, everyone was kind, helpful and friendly. The room (401) was at the front of the hotel with a french balcony overlooking the road, but as it was in the old quarter of the city this is normal. The reception area was comfortable, the dining room on floor 8 was bright and airy and breakfast had a good choice of fruit, yogurt, pastries and bread and a choice of cooked eggs. We had an evening meal after a long day out and it was exceptional, lots of menu choices, beautifully presented and very delicious. The hotel explains that whilst it is in a convenient part of the city, the views and space are not as good as the larger hotels but it makes up for that by providing excellent care and dedication and believe me that is exactly what they do. Nothing is too much trouble and all the staff go the extra mile to make your stay pleasurable. There was nothing to dislike once you realise how difficult it can be to have rooms with views. ####[['The staff at the Solaria Hotel were absolutely wonderful , everyone was kind , helpful and friendly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['was at the front of the hotel with a french balcony overlooking the road', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The reception area was comfortable', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the dining room on floor 8 was bright and airy', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['breakfast had a good choice of fruit , yogurt , pastries and bread and a choice of cooked eggs', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We had an evening meal after a long day out and it was exceptional , lots of menu choices , beautifully presented and very delicious', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['by providing excellent care and dedication and believe me that is exactly what they do', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the views and space are not as good as the larger hotels but it makes up for', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['it is in a convenient part of the city', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['all the staff go the extra mile to make your stay pleasurable', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was nothing to dislike once you realise how difficult it can be to have rooms with views', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

1580,The room was comfortable and clean, and the pool was very nice (apart from the rubbish at the bottom). It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi’s are available to get into town. The cleaning staff were very friendly. The staff weren’t helpful - there is a clear lack of management. The pool bar wait times are ridiculous, 1. 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water, 1. 5 for food as well. On our first 2 days the wait wasn’t as bad but there was only one person, the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long. The food and drink is also very overpriced (western prices) and very average. The laundry service is ridiculously expensive, we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear! There is no local advice available from the staff. We weren’t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren’t offered the welcome drink they advertise. Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment. The breakfast is constantly running out, and even if all the food and drink is available, there are no cups or plates to use! The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover, there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it. Overall, this is a 3 star experience, but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it’s a good option. ####[['The room was comfortable and clean , and the pool was very nice', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi ’ s are available to get into town', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The cleaning staff were very friendly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The staff weren ’ t helpful - there is a clear lack of management', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The pool bar wait times are ridiculous', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['1 . 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water , 1 . 5 for food as well', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['On our first 2 days the wait wasn ’ t as bad but there was only one person , the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The laundry service is ridiculously expensive , we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The food and drink is also very overpriced', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['and very average', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['There is no local advice available from the staff', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We weren ’ t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren ’ t offered the welcome drink they advertise', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The breakfast is constantly running out , and even if all the food and drink is available , there are no cups or plates to use', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover , there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['this is a 3 star experience , but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it ’ s a good option', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

138437,This was our best accomodation in Vietnam. There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses. There are small pools with fish and water flowers, it is like in a fairy-tale. I really recommend the place. Our bathroom was in the back of the house, outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle. Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also. We arrived in february and the weather was perfect. Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area. This is perfect for nature lovers. The room itself was clean and spacious. Clean towels and linen. The young ladies at the reception are welkoming and very helpful with everything you need. They organised transportation, help with motorcicle or motorbike rental, offer info and help with everything. They are very kind. They organised us the boat tour to floating market and arranged us the transportation to their places and then to the airport in Can Tho based on our group needs. Excellent comunication with them. The place is in the rural area near Can Tho so it is interesting to explore the villages by bicicle and see how people live, make an idea of how the life in around water canals. There is a local-style minimarket at walking distance from the accomodation. If you dont ride bicicle or motorbike the area might look a bit remote. We found no other place to eat at walking distance but we reached a small town at 6 km of bicicle ride with the help of google maps where you can find everything. We bought some exotic interesting fruits there in the fruit market and brought them at the accomodation and enjoyed them in the eating area. The boat tour on the canals and at the floating market revealed a lot of pollution. Plastic waste floating everywhere. It is very sad to see that. Otherwise it is interesting to see the trade at the floating market. ####[['This was our best accomodation in Vietnam', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There are small pools with fish and water flowers , it is like in a fairy - tale', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I really recommend the place', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our bathroom was in the back of the house , outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area .

253,A Friend's Recommendation Unveils the Magic of Zizi Homestay in Sapa I am filled with immense excitement as I recount my extraordinary journey to the captivating landscapes of Sapa, Vietnam. Inspired by a friend's heartfelt recommendation, I embarked on a quest to discover the hidden treasures of this enchanting region. My adventure led me to the remarkable Zizi Homestay, and I can confidently say that it was an experience that exceeded all expectations—a journey that was truly worth every moment. Upon arriving at Zizi Homestay, I was instantly captivated by the beauty of its surroundings. Nestled amidst the awe-inspiring landscapes of Sapa, it stood as a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and culture. The gentle embrace of Zizi's warm hospitality and the sincere smiles of the Hmong people made me feel instantly at ease. It was evident from the very beginning that my friend's recommendation was a precious gift. The allure of Zizi Homestay extended far beyond its idyllic setting. It was a gateway to the vibrant tapestry of Hmong culture. With boundless enthusiasm, Zizi welcomed me into her world, eager to share the rich heritage and traditions of her community. I was invited to immerse myself in the fascinating art of batik dyeing, guided by the skilled hands of the Hmong artisans. It was a mesmerizing experience that allowed me to witness firsthand the intricate craftsmanship and the indomitable spirit woven into every stitch. Throughout my stay, Zizi proved to be an extraordinary hostess, going above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of my journey was filled with wonder and delight. From guiding me on breathtaking treks through the emerald rice terraces to introducing me to the flavors of traditional Hmong cuisine, Zizi's genuine care and passion created an atmosphere of true warmth and hospitality. ####[]

They also offered us free breakfast for our entire stay in celebration of reopening after covid. The rooms were squeaky clean and well equipped.

139572,Bamboo Farmstay is where I enjoyed the most authentic Vietnamese hospitality experience of my entire trip. The owner, Nam, his sister, and the entire family were extremely kind, attentive, and caring throughout our stay. Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh, but I insisted on paying for it, as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me. Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex, a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future. I highly recommend visiting this area now, before the crowds descend. Nam's farmstay is a hidden gem, and I'm glad I chose it over other homestays that were located in a cramped area with a challenging road. This farmstay, on the other hand, is situated on a good road, close to the main thoroughfare that leads to two of Ninh Binh's main attractions: the pagoda and the river tour. The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent, and the Vietnamese cuisine they serve is simply delicious. Although they normally close at 9 PM, they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry. While the rooms are quite basic, they offer air conditioning and hot showers, and for the price, they are an unbeatable deal - under $10 per night! You'll also have the chance to stay in a charming bamboo bungalow, which is a real treat. All in all, I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future. I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience. ####[['The owner , Nam , his sister , and the entire family were extremely kind , attentive , and caring throughout our stay', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh , but I insisted on paying for it , as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex , a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I highly recommend visiting this area now', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Although they normally close at 9 PM , they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['While the rooms are quite basic , they offer air conditioning and hot showers , and for the price , they are an unbeatable deal - under $ 10 per night', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

609,rien My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare. From the outset, the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous. The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic English. In a highly unprofessional move, he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking. com platform, promising “better apartments, better views, and more check-in options.” He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times! And after reading reviews from previous guests, I discovered that those who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn’t get any of the promised benefits. The deceit didn’t stop there. On the check-in day, the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower. This was a complete bait and switch, and it left us feeling utterly duped. To add insult to injury, the apartment itself was a disaster. The furniture was old, worn, and filthy, and the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online. It was smaller, older, and lacked any charm or modern decoration. The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding. As if that weren’t enough, the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay. We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water. It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard. In short, our stay at Landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism. I urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere. It’s simply not worth the stress, frustration, and betrayal. ####[['My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic Englis', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['In a highly unprofessional move , he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking . com platform , promising “ better apartments , better views , and more check - in options', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times !', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn ’ t get any of the promised benefits', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The deceit didn ’ t stop there', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['This was a complete bait and switch', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['it left us feeling utterly duped', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the apartment itself was a disaster', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The furniture was old , worn , and filthy', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['It was smaller , older , and lacked any charm or modern decoration .', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['our stay at Landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere', 'Loyalty', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['It ’ s simply not worth the stress , frustration , and betrayal', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

139234,The hotel is great and fully renewed a year ago. Spacious rooms, clean, close to the beach and lovely staff. Best price quality you can get by far in Vietnam! Nhung is adorable and made our stay perfect. She was always there to help with anything, be it renting a motorcycle, giving general tips, booking tickets for us or doing our laundry. The breakfast is great, you can chose one dish out of a list of ~30 dishes. We tried many of them and they were all tasty! It also includes fruits, coffee and a different juice everyday. The location is perfect if you want beach and not stay in the busy and very touristy old city town. The hotel has bikes available that you can use whenever you want to go into town (15-20 min ride ) or you can rent a motorcycle if you have the license. Driving in Hoi An is much easier than the busier Hanoi or Ho Chi Minh. If we ever come back to Hoi An, we will definitely stay here again! 10/10 n/a ####[['The hotel is great and fully renewed a year ago', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Spacious rooms , clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['close to the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['lovely staff', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Best price quality you can get by far in Vietnam', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Nhung is adorable and made our stay perfect', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['She was always there to help with anything', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['be it renting a motorcycle , giving general tips , booking tickets for us or doing our laundry', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The breakfast is great , you can chose one dish out of a list of ~ 30 dishes', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We tried many of them and they were all tasty !

139112,We purposely chose Sapa Clayhouse as the finale of our Vietnam trip and it was such a treat for us. We booked the executive suite. Everything inside the room was perfect. We went in mid December their winter season, and we were pleasantly surprised that the bed was heated. The decor and furnishings of the entire place were tastefully done up too, so pretty that we requested to buy some vases as souvenirs. The staffs were all very professional and polite. Food was really good too, everything we ordered was a hit. And try their signature house cocktail mix it was so good! Highly highly highly recommend to make this place your last stop in Sapa. We were a little shocked that the housekeeping team actually went into our room to clean up while we were at the dining area having our meal. It was a nice and attentive gesture but would appreciate the option for us to choose if we want the service or not, as for our personal preference, we prefer not to have housekeeping service during our stay to prevent any mishaps.

1631,Breakfast was excellent, catering for eastern and western tastes. The open sided sunrise room was high up and gave beautiful views of the resort and the beach. Our room was very good, with a huge 8ft bed, everything was very clean. The beach was out of this world, wonderful. The hills, to leave the resort one was required to walk up a very steep hill for approximately 200/300 yards. We only did it once, never again. The temperature was 30°c plus. The resort has golf buggies which stand idle for much of the day, surely they could be used to ferry guests to the top and down again if necessary. The security man could easily be used and it would make his job a bit more fulfilling. Taxis are available and not expensive but it goes against the grain to pay for taxes every time you need to do little shopping. ####[['Breakfast was excellent , catering for eastern and western tastes', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The open sided sunrise room was high up and gave beautiful views of the resort and the beach', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our room was very good , with a huge 8ft bed , everything was very clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The beach was out of this world , wonderful', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hills , to leave the resort one was required to walk up a very steep hill for approximately 200 / 300 yards', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The temperature was 30 ° c plus', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The resort has golf buggies', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The security man could easily be used and it would make his job a bit more fulfilling', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Taxis are available and not expensive', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it goes against the grain to pay for taxes every time you need to do little shopping', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

Although it is close to Bui Vien street (also known as a walking party street), the guesthouse is located in a little alley, where the music from the bars can't be heard. The highlight of my stay was Ms Vy, she is an excellent host! Ms Vy accompanied me to the local banh mi festival that was happening during my stay. She was great, explaining the local dishes and helping me order food. With her I got to try many delicious Vietnamese food. After that we went on a walk and did a little bit of sightseeing. She also gave a little map with everything explained, including some words in Vietnamese in case you need to ask directions to locals!

1558,Beautiful open see through lobby, lovely ocean view rooms with a balcony, superb breakfast buffet, wonderful staff and service, and a playroom for the kids with an attendant. The location is perfect, in the city but quieter when compared to the main road area. We ate at the restaurant several times, the seafood buffet was good, a la carte was really good too. The spa was lovely. We were very happy with our stay at Furama. It was great overall, we were very happy with our stay, difficult to find anything wrong. To note, for a family of 2 adults + 2 children, it would make sense to book an ocean view suite rather than take a garden view room. This is because when they say 2 twin beds, it means 2 single beds in the garden room which aren't useful for 2 adults and 2 kids. So you have to take an extra bed at an added cost. Hence for a similar price, take the ocean view room which come with 2 platform sofa's which can convert to 2 kids beds and a fantastic view!

139620,The location is central, there is a supermarket nearby, nice Banh-Mi-Stands around the corner and a coffee shop closeby (E-Coffee). There were toilet amenities (soap, TP, toothbrush). The AC was working and quiet. We booked this hotel. We arrived after a long journey, and a sign was saying: we send you a message with all booking infos to self check-in. Said message never arrived. I contacted the responsible, who was quick to answer: we have issues with the climate control we have to rebook you to another location. That's how we got to Supertramp. Funny thing: it happened to another lady while we were there and she told us they rebooked her because the other one was full. This hotel looks way nicer than the other - which is why we think it's a scam. Now, reading other reviews, I realized it happened before. Coming to Supertramp:It's a construction site!At first we got offered a room with no window, which was not what we booked. They showed us another room, which we took. The room contained a kitchen and a washing-maschine (both not working) and a bed. The room was so tiny that we couldn't put our bags on the ground. Why do you put a not functioning kitchen+machine if there is no space already?!The cupboards were moist, some dirty towels were roting in them. The room was dirty. I made the mistake of looking behind the bed and in the cupboard - so much dirt, dust and spiderwebs. The walls are quite thin and not soundproof, so we heard everything (from neighbors to elevator and construction work).We wanted to pay online, but they didn't accept it: only cash. As we just arrived, we didn't have VND yet and explained that we would contact them as soon as we did and pay the bill. We stayed 3 days. Within the first day we got contacted 3 times to ask for the money (even though we previously made an agreement). In the end we got woken up by a random lady the next morning at 8a. m (she wouldn't stop knocking, spoke no English, just said "money,money". Nobody told us she would come and wake us up. I texted the responsible guy and told him this is not acceptable.

It was nice to have breakfast in the room. You can choose to have brekkie by the pool, in the lobby area or in your room. They even made sure to offer us glutenfree breakfast. Pool is quite small but in a nice area with sauna and steamroom which you can turn on yourself. Shower / toilet have been built against a huge rock, which makes the area quite unique. The spa upstairs is great, the massage therapists are very good, and one spa treatment is included in the room price. With the free shuttle bus you can go anywhere in the town. Motorbike can be parked in the parking hall. Whoever built the Wind hotels concept knows a lot about excellent customer service and customer retention.

524,We ended up staying at the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, so I can only comment on that. Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom. We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool. Breakfast was very good and a sensible price. if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel. Very handy little shop called Moon Milk on the street corner. A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage. The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing. We landed on a (relatively) cold and rainy evening and took the long taxi ride from Da Nang airport. The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance. We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that. There was a notice on the door saying to go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, giving the address. A sketch map would have been useful! It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel. The gentleman on reception took us up to a room, leading in and coming back out very rapidly. Obviously there was some kind of problem, and he wished to be professional about it. He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card. We were ushered to another room, which was clearly an upgrade. Whilst it lacked a couple of things (such as a toilet roll, which appeared the next day), it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom. To the credit of the manager, he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances. ####[['Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast was very good and a sensible price', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['A sketch map would have been useful', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The gentleman on reception took us up to a room , leading in and coming back out very rapidly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Obviously there was some kind of problem , and he wished to be professional about it', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['We were ushered to another room , which was clearly an upgrade', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Whilst it lacked a couple of thing', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['To the credit of the manager , he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

1135,The view from the room My stay was a marathon of mistakes.

Then I want to go to the pool, so I leave my room - but oh the keyroom reader on my door doesn’t work - turns out battery ran out! So I go to the lobby and ask the lobby guy to fix it. He promises to come back in a moment to do so, so I wait for him in my room. Doesnt show up. Had to go ask for it AGAIN the next day for this guy to do his work (of course no one at the reception figured that it would perhaps be a good idea to call me and let me know he wont show up using the room phone next to bed) And then to top it off, its about 3:10 am in the middle of the night and now the hotel room telephone built in next to my bed rings. I pick it up. Nothing. Well, thanks for giving me a call in the middle of the night smart person at the reception So yeah it wasnt a good stay.

The description and facilities of the hotel listing matches up and everything is in perfect working order, including the gym and the pool. The room was cleaned to an amazing standard and the lobby, dining area, pool and gym were always spotless. There are free bikes to use at the hotel which we loved and took them to Old Town and discovered the local area. The staff are on hand 24/7 to help out and even have a Whats App if you need their assistance whilst out etc. If you need anything the staff are happy to help. Ms. Kim was super helpful and gave us so many recommendations on local cuisine, activities and shows and also assisted in booking us tickets. We loved how the breakfast was freshly made and the staff kindly accommodated my allergies. There are several local options and amazing fresh fruit too. We will definitely be back and we recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Hoi An - you will receive the best hospitality experience!! If we could give a higher rating than 10/10 we absolutely would. ####[['every member of staff made us feel welcomed and went above and beyond for us , making our stay in this lovely hotel so very special', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we really didn ’ t want to leave', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The description and facilities of the hotel listing matches up', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room was cleaned to an amazing standard and the lobby , dining area , pool and gym were always spotless', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The staff are on hand 24 / 7 to help out and even have a Whats App if you need their assistance whilst out etc .

138850,The staff are so friendly and helpful. They really want to help you make the most of Da Lat and have lots of helpful suggestions. We were able to book our onwards bus tickets through the hotel. The included breakfast is tasty, with several choices, and you are welcome to more, which is nice. Lots of cute dogs live at the guesthouse!The room was a nice size and had everything we needed. There was no AC but the room had a fan, and as Da Lat is so cool at night, you didn't miss AC. The guesthouse is well located and there are lots of nice shops, little coffee shops, bars and restaurants nearby. Not too far from the night market, maybe 10 minutes by foot. It's great value for money! The bathroom was connected to the one next door and so we could hear everything that the guests next door were saying. It's worth noting that two of the dogs are very friendly and like being petted, but two of them are not. We observed them snapping at/biting several other guests who went to touch them a couple of times. We absolutely love dogs but were a little bit concerned to see this. ####[['The staff are so friendly and helpful .

We shared more than one bottle and on the next day I was feeling good - so no hangover at all!) But since you are there, and in case you are afraid of a hangover, enjoy the best coconuts you'll ever have in your life! Besides that, They provide you everything you need and also help you to plan you trip in the region. Don't miss the boat trip with her and her father!The room has its flair. I really loved the window. The location itself is really beautiful!I would highly recommend to sit there close to the River and watch the Moon rise.

140057,Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely, airy, clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea. The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city, particularly at night. The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter's birthday (highly recommend for a fun afternoon/evening) Breakfast is great in the hotel, but there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about. Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night. Be prepared though as it was very busy on all the surrounding streets, so if you don't like crowds, you'll have to see the fire-breathing from a distance !! This is isn't a criticism of the hotel, but be aware there is a lot of development going on in Da Nang and lots of construction site. On one of the days there was a lot of drilling and banging coming from a nearby site and there is a stage on the beach directly below the hotel that plays loud music most night until 11pm. Also be prepared for noise form the street outside (tooting of horns, etc) and also the fact the beach is packed at 5. 30am with people watching the sunrise. None of these things can be controlled by the hotel though and they didn't detract from our stay. In short, if you want peace and quiet Da Nang is probably not the place for you.... ####[['Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely , airy , clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city , particularly at night', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter ' s birthday", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast is great in the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

139855,Good location around 5 minutes from the beach. The rooftop pool had a good view across the city. The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con, comfy bed, fridge, toiletries. The hotel was very noisy. We had a large family who used the hallway and lift as a playground, with the children screaming and crying while the parents shouted up and down the hallway from 5. 30am until midnight each day. We told reception who didn't care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy. There are alarms on the hotel bedroom doors as they are awkward to close, the alarms are good for safety however the other rooms would leave their doors open with the alarms beeping from early until late which again kept us awake. The hotel is not 4*, more 2 or 3*, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating. The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily. The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up. We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym, just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment, no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill. There are lots of hotels in the area - I wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price. ####[['Good location around 5 minutes from the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The rooftop pool had a good view across the city .', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con , comfy bed , fridge , toiletries', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hotel was very noisy', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["We told reception who didn ' t care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The hotel is not 4 *, more 2 or 3 *, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym , just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment , no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

The room (double room with private bathroom) was EXTREMELY noisy - and this is coming someone who isn't very sensitive to noise/can sleep almost everywhere. I understand it's impossible for it to be completely quiet as the room faces the street and is opposite a school but better windows really need to be installed or, at the very least, thicker velvet curtains that would keep the sound out. On top of that, there was a hole in the upper pane of balcony doors.

Approximately 11km from the City centre. 11km in Hanoi is not 11km like my country where traffic is smoother. It would be more suitable for those who has business nearby. Surrounding area still much to be desired. As for Quality of Rooms its Excellent. For a Foreigner i had to rely on Ehailing or Taxi but during my stay it was a bit difficult to get one. Perhaps the Hotel should have Transport facilities for Transport. ####[['The Staff were excellent .

140206,Halong Bay is a must when you travel to Vietnam, and there are many options out there. We did a lot of research on the number of days to stay on the boat and also, which company to use. We opted for Le Theatre cruise 2 days 1 Night (2D1N), because of the itinerary and the activities. The boat itself is very luxurious and you feel like a star when the crew welcomes you on board. The cruise was not busy and so we had the chance to be upgraded to their best suite, for free! Views were absolutely incredible from that room. The food in the evening is also good, attention to the details was appreciated. Highly recommend this company, as it is one of our highlights of our trip. Make sure to book the luxury limousine transport from Hanoi to the boat, it's worth it!!! Thanks to everyone who helped us during our stay, you guys were absolutely wonderful. ####[['The boat itself is very luxurious and you feel like a star when the crew welcomes you on board', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The cruise was not busy and so we had the chance to be upgraded to their best suite , for free', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Views were absolutely incredible from that room', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The food in the evening is also good , attention to the details was appreciated', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Highly recommend this company , as it is one of our highlights of our trip', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Thanks to everyone who helped us during our stay', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['you guys were absolutely wonderful', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

Location is good as it’s not located by the main road which can be noisy but it’s just right behind the main road and is walking distance to the beach. The breakfast is pretty decent and has everything for a wholesome breakfast. The wooden blinds in the bathroom was difficult to operate. The toiletries provided - shower cream, shampoo & conditioner could be better. The rattan interior also needs some fixing as the cabinet doors with rattan was damaged when we checked in. ####[['We like the design aesthetic of the hotel which gives a very authentic local vibes', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The garden view studio has a nice pair of lounge chairs with a small coffee table facing the outside garden', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We also loved the indoor koi fish pond which was full of giant koi fishes swimming around', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Staff service is excellent and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Location is good as it ’ s not located by the main road which can be noisy but it ’ s just right behind the main road and is walking distance to the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The breakfast is pretty decent and has everything for a wholesome breakfast', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The wooden blinds in the bathroom was difficult to operate', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The toiletries provided - shower cream , shampoo & conditioner could be better', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The rattan interior also needs some fixing as the cabinet doors with rattan was damaged when we checked in', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

The staff were pleasant and friendly, with good recommendations and great English skills. They switched us to a different room quickly and without a hassle when my friend and I didn't want to share our hostel room with loud guests.

While the pool is a nice addition, it's rather small. The breakfast provided was really lacking variety though, and what they did have was not very nice.

1439,The property is converted from an old government office building to homestay. Its design is based on the concept of local ethnic groups in Sapa. You could see the owner put a lot of efforts on the design and materials used. Many recycled and traditional local ethnic group materials are used in the homestay. The staff were super helpful and friendly during my stay. They recommended some cafes with awesome view and try their best to fulfill my request. This homestay serve vegan food for lunch and dinner. I tried their local Vietnamese style began food and it was delicious. The chef has many years of working experience in hospitality line. She worked in 5-stars resorts in South East Asia and Middle East. As it was low season due to covid-19, the owner took extra mile by offering me a personal trip from Sapa to Y Ty when i asked him for tour package. It was a wonderful experience although the journey was not easy for me.

417,We were received by Mr. Danh and his wife, who both run this motel. Such a warm and friendly welcome! They even texted us before our arrival to check if we had any trouble locating the property. We were doing a motorcycle trip in Vietnam, and were riding from Hue to Hoi An. Decided to stop by Canh Duong Motel for a night's rest. Motel is easy to locate on Google Maps, situated next to a beach with PLENTY of seafood restaurants to choose from. Mr Danh is very friendly and an excellent host - he also speaks good English so communication was no problem. Mr Danh actually lives in the community, so he provided great guide to the local eateries and roads which was useful for us. Our room had very clean and shiny tiled floors, large bathroom with great water pressure and heated water. Air-conditioning worked very well. Many reviews highlighted the firm bed, but it is actually firm yet comfortable! Power socket points were convenient. Accomodation was perfect!

139250,The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture. There were ample electrical socketss. The bathroom and plumbing was quite good. The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy. There was plenty of parking near the gate. There was easy access to a lovely clean beach, direct from the resort. There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures. it was surrounded by trees giving ample shade to the loungers. The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view. There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure, Napoli being the best. We have used this one many times in the past. There are some small local shops ( kiosks) for basic needs. The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer. Not much! Like a lot of the resorts here, they suffer from a lack of customers during covid so have an air of being a bit run-down. However the faults were minor and did not detract from our stay. The restaurant only had a partial service due to lack of customers. There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning, when the resort filled up for the weekend. At other times there was a limited menu. There wasn't anywhere to hang wet clothes after, say, a swim and nothing to sit on outside. ####[['The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There were ample electrical socketss', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The bathroom and plumbing was quite good', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was plenty of parking near the gate', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was easy access to a lovely clean beach , direct from the resort', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure , Napoli being the best', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There are some small local shops ( kiosks ) for basic needs', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning , when the resort filled up for the weekend', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['At other times there was a limited menu', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["There wasn ' t anywhere to hang wet clothes after , say , a swim and nothing to sit on outside", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

We stayed 3 nights, coffee was between tepid and cold all 3 days, even when it was "brought in fresh".Internet really slow in room and kept disconnecting (getting used to that -minor issue)Bathrooms need to be cleaned better, soap holder had remnants of atleast 3 different soaps in it. ####[['Fantastic staff', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast was in the building next door and had what we thought were a good selection of both Western and Asian', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Rooms were large and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Location is great', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We had a room at the back so was not bothered by noise from the walking street', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast service is a bit hit and miss', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Internet really slow in room and kept disconnecting', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Bathrooms need to be cleaned better , soap holder had remnants of atleast 3 different soaps in it', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

138724,Nice hotel, but very busy with locals this time of year. Appears that several members of the staff are trainees, and were frazzled with the number of people checking in at the same time. The breakfast buffet was very good, the dinner buffet was not ideal for vegetarians, but the choices for others were very good. The hotel is a nice modern hotel with 3 towers of rooms connected by a bridge. Nice view of Lan Ha bay from each room. It is a short walk into town, or you can arrange for an electric car to take you.- for 10,000 vnd ea. All in all, a very nice hotel, but the experience would have been better had it not been so noisy. Not the hotel's fault, it's the locals having a good time on their vacy. :).. That being said, I would stay here again. Rooms a a little small, but manageable. The bathroom just has an open bathtub to shower...Very inefficient. Very messy.

The decoration of the hotel is beautiful and modern but with warm and bright colours. You can't actually open the window in the room (since it's a big one with view on the area) so that's what I didn't appreciate since I like having air coming into my room. Especially one girl, at the restaurant/lounge area don't know how to smile, that's so impolite, they have a face like you're annoying, and giving them some job to do they don't want to do.

1783,I had an absolutely wonderful stay at this apartment. The location was amazing, with a plethora of authentic local food options just a 5-minute walk away. However, the highlight for me was the stunning pool, where I spent many relaxing moments and admired the beautiful surroundings. Additionally, sitting on the balcony and enjoying a drink was a delightful experience. Hannah, the host, was simply fantastic. She was incredibly kind and helpful throughout my stay, providing valuable suggestions on local attractions and activities. Thanks to Hannah's support, I had an incredible travel experience without any issues. I am genuinely satisfied with my stay and cannot wait to return. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone seeking a memorable vacation. Not only does it boast an excellent location, but it is also comfortable and well-equipped. I had plenty of space to relax and make the most of my holiday. The balcony offered a lovely spot to take in the scenery and enjoy breakfast or an evening beverage.

958,We had 2 rooms with street view. The rooms were a bit musty but once the aircon kicked in it wasn't too bad. Beds are hard and water flows out from shower to toilet room. There is a lift to ground floor but you then need to go down another 2 set of stairs to get to the pool. Not good for people in wheelchairs or with mobility issues. I ended up having to go outside and walk down driveway to get to pool. Repeatedly asked to get mini fridge replaced in one room but they had no idea. Kept saying yes and everyday it still didn't work. Gave up after 3 days. The breakfast was quite good. Had a variety of food for buffet and even on the day they did a la carte there was a good choice. Only a 10 min walk to night market. The pool looked nice and the kids enjoyed it. They do supply a towel for swimming. They need more people that can understand English at the front desk. Not sure I would use it again but it was fairly cheap.

138323,absolutely gorgeous, even better in real life - felt like a boutique-y four seasons. the bar on the top floor was beautiful and all of the food at the restaurant fantastic. whoever designed or built the hotel is clearly a world traveler with impeccable taste. gym was really nice too (did not take advantage of the spa) service was great except at the pool - constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the (quite large) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don’t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down. It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting, you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes. Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment, you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot (or didn’t understand because of language barrier?). Then by then the food is cold. Frequently saw 2-3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention. Also, the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours (this was a Monday afternoon) stirring up lots of insects. Why isn’t this done early morning or evening when there are less people trying to enjoy the pool? If it weren’t for the pool experience being unpleasant, I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation. Because of this, I don’t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn’t enjoyable to sit by the pool. But we still would come back for the rooms, gym and food. ####[['absolutely gorgeous , even better in real life', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['all of the food at the restaurant fantastic', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the bar on the top floor was beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['felt like a boutique - y four seasons', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['gym was really nice too', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['service was great except at the pool', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the ( quite large ) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don ’ t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting , you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment , you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Then by then the food is cold', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Frequently saw 2 - 3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['stirring up lots of insects', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I don ’ t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn ’ t enjoyable to sit by the pool', 'Loyalty', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['But we still would come back for the rooms , gym and food', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['If it weren ’ t for the pool experience being unpleasant , I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation', 'Branding', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

The gym is great with good facilities, we had a lovely massage at the spa, and the pool area is gorgeous it’s just such a shame we couldn’t enjoy it as the weather was sadly terrible for entire duration of our stay!

1137,The location in the Old Quarter was fantastic and close to everything. The street at the front of the hotel is closed at the weekend, so you may struggle to be dropped outside. This really isn't a problem! All staff were fantastic. There are so many trips and variations on offer and so it was difficult to know what was best for the budget. We listened to Mai's advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted. Everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back. For trips to Sapa, I would recommend the individual cabin on the bus as this was a godsend after such a long walk, try to get the cabin near the front as the ride is smoother and take mosquito spray. Travelling with children, Mai made this much more relaxed!

As for communication I used to write directly to the guy in whatsapp in English and it worked very well. If you are a nature lover, you can't miss this stage. I had a hard time figuring out how to get there, better to contact the facility in advance and ask for directions. Pu Luong as far as tourism is concerned is not yet developed e. g. with already organized tours, you have to plan well for travel within and figure out what you want to see maybe ask the family for advice in advance.

139460,Our experience at Zizi homestay in Sapa was a spiritual journey that allowed us to witness the sacred rituals and beliefs of the Hmong community. The lodge, surrounded by towering peaks, provided a breathtaking setting for our trek. The guided trek led us through sacred sites, ancient temples, and shared moments of spiritual reflection. Each step felt like a step towards embracing the sacred wisdom of Hmong culture. The reverent hosts guided us through traditional ceremonies, offering us insight into their spiritual practices. Back at the lodge, we were treated to a sacred ritual, witnessing the deep reverence the Hmong have for their ancestors and nature. As the sun set, we gathered for a contemplative meditation session, enveloped in the profound tranquility of the mountains. While our overall experience was fantastic, some guests noticed occasional water supply disruptions, which added to the rustic charm but might cause minor inconveniences. However, it became an opportunity to appreciate the sacred connection the lodge has with nature and the mountains. The spiritual awakening we experienced through this sacred encounter. ####[['Our experience at Zizi homestay in Sapa was a spiritual journey that allowed us to witness the sacred rituals and beliefs of the Hmong community', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The lodge , surrounded by towering peaks , provided a breathtaking setting for our trek', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['While our overall experience was fantastic , some guests noticed occasional water supply disruptions , which added to the rustic charm but might cause minor inconveniences', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

The room was extremely dark as our window looked out onto a wall and a roof top with broken air conditioner units on. We booked a family room as we were travelling with our teenage son - house keeping did not replace or restock shower gel, towels or bathroom mats during out 3 night stay. They took the dirty towels away without replacing new ones. I had to constantly ask house keeping to replace our towels. The room was dusty and there were lots of small insects in the room. No counter space in the bathroom to leave toiletries. Limited hanging space/hooks to hang wet towels. Very poor for a family room.

183,The staff were friendly and helpful. The location is good, the beach is 5 minutes on foot away and there's plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. It's quite cheap. The mattress in the room was horrible. There was a huge dent in the center. At the time the hotel was being renovated, so maybe they would have changed it out, but I think they didn't. The room I stayed in had no window, so it was quite stuffy, but that was expected for the price. I peeped into a renovated higher end room on that floor (the door was open because of the construction), and it looked pretty good. The fridge didn't work (no cooling effect whatsoever) and the little bottles of shower gel and shampoo in the shower seemed to all be missing the little straws inside so you cannot really use the pump on it, which was weird?!The landromat was expensive: 120. 000vnd (or more) for a load of clothes. I literally paid a quarter of that for the same load in Hanoi's Old quarter. Also, I got changed into another room on my last day there, and that was annoying. ####[['The staff were friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["The location is good , the beach is 5 minutes on foot away and there ' s plenty of cafes , bars and restaurants nearby", 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["It ' s quite cheap", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The mattress in the room was horrible', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The room I stayed in had no window , so it was quite stuffy', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['that was expected for the price', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ["The fridge didn ' t work", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the little bottles of shower gel and shampoo in the shower seemed to all be missing the little straws inside so you cannot really use the pump on it', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The landromat was expensive', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I got changed into another room on my last day there , and that was annoying', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

The shower is great looks like quality shower heads! The reception is on 2nd floor so you have to lug your luggages up. The signage was also not easy to locate and it was on the "wrong side" of the road where cars cant stop in front of the accomodation. You have to lug your luggage and cross the road.

1455,The place is exactly as expected from the pictures and reviews. The owner helped us upgrade one twin room to a family room, and it was very spacious. She also helped arrange bikes and motorbikes for us to borrow to travel to the city center and helped troubleshoot problems when needed. Overall, we were very impressed with the hospitality. We arrived by car from Da Nang and had some trouble navigating since the alley to this place was very narrow, but there was some parking space in front of the villa itself so it wasn't a problem. You will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away (free bikes, motorbikes, car - bit difficult considering the alley, or taxis and other options).Some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim - to fit the vibe. I wouldn't recommend this place for those with small children because the pool facilities and general structure of the place are not very child-friendly. ####[['The place is exactly as expected from the pictures and reviews', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The owner helped us upgrade one twin room to a family room', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it was very spacious', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['She also helped arrange bikes and motorbikes for us to borrow to travel to the city center and helped troubleshoot problems when needed', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Overall , we were very impressed with the hospitality', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['there was some parking space in front of the villa itself', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['You will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away', 'Amenity', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["I wouldn ' t recommend this place for those with small children", 'Loyalty', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the pool facilities and general structure of the place are not very child - friendly', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

There were limited options at breakfast, which was just ok. That was not a huge issue, though, because we wanted to explore the food in the city. Wifi was spotty, but we noticed that the internet service at most hotels in Vietnam were like that. ####[['Our room was spacious and well thought out', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The service was warm , efficient , and attentive , and everyone spoke English fluently', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The pool is small and shallow , so it is only good for lounging around and sunbathing', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['There were limited options at breakfast , which was just ok', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Wifi was spotty', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

138861,Comfortable bed. Clean rooms. Great location. Pool was nice. Brutal check out experience. They advertise 24 hour reception so I thought nothing of checking out early in the morning to catch my 6 AM bus to the airport. There was nobody in reception except a security guard who, upon my spouse and I loading our bags onto the bus, proceeded to make a scene (yelling at myself and the driver) that I had yet to pay. I went inside to pay and found out he (security guard) could not administer payment. He had trouble getting ahold of the man in charge of reception. Meanwhile my bus driver was beginning to unload our things and was attempting to kick us off the bus as we were now behind schedule. I pleaded to him, explaining that the hotel had my credit info and I could be billed, and made the same plea to the security guard. To no avail. I was now refusing to get off the bus because I had a flight to catch, and caught between two men screaming at eachother and at me. I'm not sure I've faced that level of anxiety before in my life. All due to a false promise of 24 hour reception. Anyway, don't rely on the 24 hour reception, and don't expect to be treated with common decency by the staff (this doesn't apply to the guy working reception, he was actually kind and respectful). ####[['Comfortable bed .

The hotel is also split into two so we went to the wrong hotel first - but they are only about 20 metres apart so not a big issues though we also had to go to the other hotel for breakfast, We were on the 7th floor and had to take an incredibly slow lift to the 6th floor and then stairs to the 7th - worth considering if you have mobility issues.

If you are staying in this hotel, I highly recommend booking the combined basket boat tour and cooking lessons with Mr Cu. It was fun for us. We were upgraded to the top floor but the room was not clean e. g. candy wrappers from previous guest, mirror is not clean and the bathroom has molds. We asked to be transfered to another room and they did. The next room was okay but I woke up in the middle of the night smelling molds again. I hope they will make some updates of the building. Second, the breakfast is okay but a bit limited. Lastly, we felt that the ladies at the reception are intrusive. For example, the moment we arrived, we just want a rest as we were tired but she was selling us many many things like tours or tailors and repeat many unnecessary information which was annoying for us. They keep asking questions like who is your taxi driver, where are you going, which store?.. I mean, I understand they get some kind of commision but please we are on our holiday and we decide where to buy stuff. On our last day, the lady tried to convinced us to stay one more night in their hotel and beg to give them 10 review which didnt sit well on us.

1407,The boat itself is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay. It feels magical. The staff were extremely kind and welcoming. We did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized. Kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in Vietnam. All the food was quite good and was included. But, FYI if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise. The staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood. The baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window, so you can look out at the bay, which is great. This ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay. The balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures. No drinks are included and although they have a buy 2 get 1 free happy hour, the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying it would be nice if they were included. On the last day as well we went on the tour to the caves on the bamboo boats, which was great to see.

139544,I stayed more than a week and wow, the service of the staff all the way from Mary the general manager, to Eric and the others at the front desk was super and exceeded my expectations. It was Ritz Carlton level service. Breakfast was perfect, delicious and so many options, they also have an espresso machine but that’s extra (regular coffee and tea is free). There is such kind staff in the breakfast, so attentive to be sure the guests are comfortable and happy. My bed and pillows were so comfortable (standard double room) and a really nice marble shower. I did not have a window but i wouldn’t have opened it bc the a/c was on and i wouldn’t want to let mosquitos in. The room did not need a window, it felt very open and nice and very sweetly furnished — the designer of the hotel had very good taste. Especially the huge fuchsia colored chandelier in the lobby! I feel it’s important to allow guests to fill up water bottles with the hotel’s purified water so guests do not use plastic bottles and add to environmental plastic waste for sweet vietnam ####[['the service of the staff all the way from Mary the general manager , to Eric and the others at the front desk was super and exceeded my expectations', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast was perfect , delicious and so many options , they also have an espresso machine but that ’ s extra', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There is such kind staff in the breakfast , so attentive to be sure the guests are comfortable and happy', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['My bed and pillows were so comfortable ( standard double room ) and a really nice marble shower', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I did not have a window but i wouldn ’ t have opened it bc the a / c was on and i wouldn ’ t want to let mosquitos in', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The room did not need a window , it felt very open and nice and very sweetly furnished', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the designer of the hotel had very good taste', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Especially the huge fuchsia colored chandelier in the lobby', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I feel it ’ s important to allow guests to fill up water bottles with the hotel ’ s purified water so guests do not use plastic bottles and add to environmental plastic waste for sweet vietnam', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

139586,This is the first bad review i’ve ever written so far. We booked this hotel because they should offer a buffet breakfast and they should also have a gym. But non of them was provided. There is also almost no breakfast possibilities in the sourroundings exept pho or seafood. We booked a deluxe room in a (apparently) 4 star hotel, but the room we more like a good budget doubleroom. The queensize bed was cozy, but iz was not one double bed but 2 single beds next to each other. The room was only cleaned once during the stay of 4 days. So in conclusion we would not recommend this hotel if you expect a little bit more comfort. ####[['We booked this hotel because they should offer a buffet breakfast and they should also have a gym .

The amenities and appliances in the room are that of a 4 star hotel. The location is spot-on, by the Long Bien bridge and right at the entrance of the old quarters, but in a quiet alleyway. Above all, the staff was always gracious, caring and efficient. Ms Minh Hoang in particular, at the reception, went above and beyond to ensure us a smooth stay.

1300,The breakfast served at the pantry on the 5th floor every morning was good because I could have a light breakfast. In particular, the soup of rice noodles is very delicious, so I recommend you to try it. The location of the accommodation is near Miding, but it's a little far away. Please note that it's not a distance that you can't walk at all, but it'll be a burden to walk in the middle of the heat. Fortunately, you can visit various attractions in Hanoi using the grap service. The room condition is very very excellent. A comfortable bed and living room(has a comfortable sofa) are provided, and simple cooking is possible with a simple kitchen. I was able to travel comfortably because they cleaned and managed it every day. Also, there was a washing machine on the balcony, and it was so nice to be able to wash wet clothes with sweat. The product description says that there are four bathrooms in three rooms, but in reality, there are three bathrooms in three rooms. The toilet tissue location is so far away that you have to twist your body into an acrobatic way to touch the tissue. There is no space to put shampoo or soap in the shower booth. There's not enough space to put soap in the sink. In addition, it does not provide soap.

139608,The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport. The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance. Owner stays just next door so it’s easy to reach out if you have any issues provided that she’s at home. Room is comfy and clean. Aircon is a little weak but it works. Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair. Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin. Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin. Owner gave the pin to the metal gate via message through Booking. com’s app but just note that the metal gate is right in front of the apartment on the 5th floor, not the big gate on ground floor facing the street. Since the apartment is located on the 2nd street away from the main road, it’s not too noisy at night. The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries. There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe. The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift. Luckily there is a cement strip laid over the staircase which probably is meant for bicycles but it works fine to roll my small suitcase up. You’re also supposed to pay your room fee upon arrival in cash - which the fault is mine since I didn’t read carefully before booking.

1826,Amazing place! If you are doubting on staying a bit outside Tam Coc center, this homestay is super close (by motorbike) and the peacefullnes and lovely nature make it worthy. Amazing garden and chill areas in the premises. The personnel exceeded all expectations. welcoming, warm and truly knowledgable. Every single offer was price correctly and plenty of options in the restaurant. They arranged bikes, scooters and transportation for us. They also count with the best laundry service in Vietnam. Really cheap by the Kilo, but carefully washed and folded. Honestly, nothing but praise for this lovely homestay.

140115,the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish, the owner and the staff generally polite, friendly and helpful. i was offered free tea during check-in and check-out. good communication via whatsapp, the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in. on arrival my scooter was brought to a safe place and they also took care of my keys and gear. Unfortunately there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds. On arrival I was warned of the nocturnal noise from the street - to be fair, before paying. However, the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs, even the mattress vibrated (and that was on the 4th floor, not directly at the street and on a tuesday) - not the hotels fault, but guests should be aware of this. After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff, they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel (30k) saying it couldn't be reused anymore (!). after i asked if it's possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away, they wanted to bill me for 200k. I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet. i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules. ####[['the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the owner and the staff generally polite , friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['i was offered free tea during check - in and check - out', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['good communication via whatsapp , the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff , they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel ( 30k ) saying it couldn ' t be reused anymore", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["i asked if it ' s possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away , they wanted to bill me for 200k", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

519,I really liked my stay at Lam Vien Homestay as it was quaint and really comfortable. I adored getting the chance to speak with owner and learn a little more about his and Hue's history. Plus, I arrived so early and they were more accomidating me as I rented a bike and joined one of the other travellers to journey together. My room was ideal, it was on the first floor and had easy access to the bathroom and privacy if wanted. Breakfast and other things were available though I didn't partake as IO have my own dietary means and wanted to see the city which is so full of history and excitement. I finally arrived late in the evening after consuming as much of the wonder that is Hue. I came back to what was supreme quiet and excellent accommodation as I prepared myself some food and go the comfort and quiet of a evening left to my own devices. Being close to both the north and south sides of Hue, I went off to explore as I would leave reasonably early the next morning and was delighted to be so well placed. I really recommend this incredible homestay and encourage you to stay as long as you can because there is so much that makes Hue ideal to travel and experience.

Ha in particular, the hostess, is a diamond woman who is so helpful and kind. The hosts were so kind and accommodating - emailing me at 7pm to check my check in time and allowing me a late check in. I don’t recommend you do this (and it’s difficult to do) but I fell in a rice paddy and they cleaned me, my clothes and made me a late dinner. It is one of the best stays I’ve ever had.

139021,Ideal Homestay to get out of the crowds. The son speaks English, the parents do not, but they are sweethearts. Always willing to help and smiling. The beach is at 10 min walk and 3 in the motorcycle. If you rent one they'll let you park it inside the homestay. It's possible to wake up every morning and swim in the ocean (I did). You can order your breakfast (made to order), go to the beach, swim and when you come back, it's waiting for you in the room, where you can enjoy it in the spacious AC Room. I was able to leave my heavy luggage with them for 3 days, at no charge, I recommend tipping though, this is a true Homestay (they live next door), they are building it up based on our visits. Quiet and a breath of fresh air (ironically in a superhot & humid weather) compared to downtown Hoi An. 15min motorcycle ride through an amazing landscape (see photos). You can find better? probably (closer to the beach... i saw a couple of places, but it's hard to beat the value.

1010,I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential. With its prime location opposite the beach, attentive staff, and impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products, my overall experience was positive. While the hotel showed promise in many aspects, the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay. I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel's recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time. It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences. However, considering the hotel had only been operational for two weeks, this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy. ####[['I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['its prime location opposite the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['attentive staff', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products , my overall experience was positive', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel ' s recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

They got in touch with us quickly and then couriered it to us at our next hotel. They did this promptly and kept us posted throughout. They even helped organise a bike for us while we were there. The decor of the room and the hotel in general was very nice! They have used natural materials in a very pleasing and balanced way. The tea set that they provided in the room was exceptional – it came with loose leaf tea, a kettle with a built-in sieve and two beautiful ceramic cups. We had a lovely view of the emerging skyline in the vibrant city of Da Nang. The room had a balcony and natural light coming in from 2 directions. The location is convenient. It's in the heart of the city – just 10-15 minutes from any other part of the city including the airport! ####[['The staff was really professional and went beyond their way to help us out', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We had forgotten our medicine pouch in the room after checking out .

139650,The hotel is brand new and has very helpful staff despite limited English. We were kindly offered a free upgrade on arrival. The complex has 3 very large pools and is located conveniently near the beach and sailing club restaurant Unfortunately/fortunately, this place around the hotel is deserted. Around 95% of the buildings are empty and therefore there is poor choice of restaurants that are much more expensive than you'd expect to pay anywhere else in Vietnam. It is around a 20-30 scooter/taxi ride to the town which can soon become costly. ####[['The hotel is brand new', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['has very helpful staff despite limited English', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We were kindly offered a free upgrade on arrival', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The complex has 3 very large pools and is located conveniently near the beach and sailing club restaurant', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

138789,Staff was great and super helpful. Breakfast was good, it was nice that you can order different dishes every morning from the menu on top of the buffet. Location was ok, not that close to old quarter but ok walking distance away. Room was cleaned well, we had a complimentary fruit basket in the room. Surfaces in the room were somewhat worn out, and there was some visible water damage in the bathroom, tiles were cracked etc. You could hear all the noises from the hallway. The walls/windows were so thin, that it felt like the windows were open because the traffic noises were so loud, and it was a little hard to sleep. Update // They asked us to do a written review about the hotel upon check out. We wrote same things on that and here in the booking review. Mostly great things about the service and staff, only complaints was the noises and the fact that the room might need some updates/renovations. We waited in the hotel lobby for a car to pick us up to the airport, and the manager came to us apologizing and they gave us a 50% refund from the car service. We thought that was unnessecary, but it felt nice that they reacted to our feedback. I also wrote this booking review waiting in the lobby, usually I wait to get out of the hotel to do that, I should’ve done it now too. The manager had seen my booking review and came back to talk to us, asking us to change the review from 8 to 10. We felt super uncomfortable that he asked us to do so. We just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. For that point we had nothing but great things to say about the staff, but now it left us with a bad taste to our mouths, and this wasn’t a great ending to our 2-week trip to Vietnam, which had been nothing but lovely so far. I had to lower the grade because we didn’t appreciate this kind of doing. ####[['Staff was great and super helpful .

Chu is not only knowledgeable about the local flora and fauna, but also about the cultural traditions of the Hmong people. Throughout the two-day trek, Chu is always there to offer assistance and make sure that everyone is enjoying themselves. His passion for the region is infectious, and he has a way of making everyone feel like family. The trek itself is stunning, with a variety of terrain to navigate, including waterfalls, streams, and valleys.

The elevator was small but worked just fine. I've read some reviews that you need to go up through small stairs, but that happened if your property is at 11th floor above. Ours was in 10th so it was fine. The host was very communicative and supportive during our stay. p. s. They also had motorbike rent, but manual only. The bed was a bit thinner that usual bed, so it was not as comfy as your common hotel bed, but we slept just fine. The blanket was very comfortable though so it helped. The ceiling was a bit low and the room was a bit older than the photos, but it was fine. There's no good food around the place and it was about 10 mins by motorbike from Old Quarter.

421,Incredibly comfortable bed. Great location. Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements. Preface: Their claim is "Beyond Perfection" and it is marketed as a "Luxury Boutique" 5 star hotel. While beautifully designed, many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience (function of light switches, relative position of shower and towel for maximum water coverage of said towels, maintenance work during check-out hours) and some elements already are showing wear and tear. For a 5 star hotel, the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training, with very odd formalities that were unnecessary, poorly executed, or just awkward. We also received a phone call to our room at 4:48am, which was a mistake by reception. When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves. (The manager did reimbursed us for transport when it was brought to her attention) The cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed. Known classics were watered down and almost unrecognisable in their taste. ####[['Incredibly comfortable bed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Great location', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['beautifully designed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['some elements already are showing wear and tear', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['For a 5 star hotel , the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training , with very odd formalities that were unnecessary , poorly executed , or just awkward', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We also received a phone call to our room at 4 : 48am , which was a mistake by reception', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Known classics were watered down and almost unrecognisable in their taste', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

They understood what we were looking for (discovering local culture and beautiful landscape).

It is a quiet place with a nice garden.- Rooms are convenient, with everything needed - The restaurant is nice.

Only minor things: - There are limited western options for breakfast but the pancakes were very good - The shower is very close to the toilet so it is a bit a mess after showering (this is specific to Vietnam though) ####[['we decided to extend our stay at the hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The family , Huyen , Thanh , Nhi and Kent are very welcoming , warm and considerate .

138483,For our wedding anniversary celebration, my family decided to stay at this lovely resort called Memorina. And wow, did it surpass our expectations! Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery, it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape. The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat, bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region. We spent hours wandering around the resort, discovering charming nooks, admiring the vibrant plant life, and even giving fishing a shot. One of the highlights was visiting the sheepfold – an experience that not only captivated us but also filled our kids with wide-eyed wonder. Watching their faces light up as they interacted with the sheep was absolutely heartwarming. During our stay, we were treated to a gentle evening rain, which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand. All in all, our time at Memorina etched a truly special memory in our family's journey. ####[['We spent hours wandering around the resort , discovering charming nooks , admiring the vibrant plant life , and even giving fishing a shot', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive , always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it surpass our expectations', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['During our stay , we were treated to a gentle evening rain , which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["our time at Memorina etched a truly special memory in our family ' s journey", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

139759,Ideally located (10 minutes walk from Van Long nature reserve - however see negative comments below), exceptionally beautiful and well maintained grounds, excellent breakfast and the dining menu at the restaurant was very good. Rooms are more like private bungalows and were clean and comfortable. The resort, despite it's beautiful trimmings is not good value money - it's actually a greedy money grab. One particular incident left a very sour note for us. The Van Long nature reserve is literally 10 minutes walk away and the normal booking price at the ticketing office for a boatman is 70k per boat. The resort charged us over 200k per person for this "tour" for which all they did was save us the walk by dropping us with their golf cart. Their golf cart driver literally paid the ticketing office the basic fee and dropped us then came back it pick us up. So essentially we paid for the convenience of a 5 minute golf cart ride. I find this extremely greedy. A resort of this of this size should upfront be offering this information and/or even providing this drop off service for free to guests.

139480,I would give this place 0 stars if it were possible. The false advertisement about free bicycles, which lead us to book this place instead of one closer to town/ the pier, was not regarded as the hotels fault. The staff, who couldn't speak English, was not willing to find a solution both parties were happy with and denied calling the manager. We offered many different solutions but all were denied by the homestay's staff and manager who was responding via Whats App. As a guest this felt very rude and the opposite of welcoming. In addition, the rooms and bathrooms are very small (smaller than advertised on booking. com) with stains on the walls and the bed sheets. Small ants were on the headboard of the bed, a lot of mould in the bathroom and dust everywhere. Even if you only want to sleep here or especially if you are looking for an all around pleasant experience, I would go somewhere else. ####[['I would give this place 0 stars if it were possible', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The false advertisement about free bicycles , which lead us to book this place instead of one closer to town / the pier , was not regarded as the hotels fault', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["The staff , who couldn ' t speak English , was not willing to find a solution both parties were happy with and denied calling the manager", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["We offered many different solutions but all were denied by the homestay ' s staff and manager who was responding via Whats App", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['As a guest this felt very rude and the opposite of welcoming', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['In addition , the rooms and bathrooms are very small', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['smaller than advertised on booking . com', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['stains on the walls and the bed sheets', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Small ants were on the headboard of the bed , a lot of mould in the bathroom and dust everywhere', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I would go somewhere else', 'Loyalty', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

Through them it was nearly a quarter of the price! Remember it is a budget priced hotel in a great location so keep that in mind if you book. Our bathroom had been remodelled which was nice.

1498,The hostel's staff is one of the nicest and kindest I've met during my travesl. They always take interest in you and are very patient and helpful, and give the hostel a homey feeling. The rooms are spacious, nice and cosy, good smell, and the beds are super comfortable. I really liked the storage arrangment. I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that! The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom. First, it was located on the bottom floor seperated from all the rooms in the hostel. The way there is exposed with no ceiling. On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom. I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way. The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well. As it is raining quite often in Sapa I think that's a problem... also there's only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel. Another thing to mind is the location - it's about 10-15 min. climb up the hill from town. It's not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather. ####[["The hostel ' s staff is one of the nicest and kindest I ' ve met during my travesl", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They always take interest in you and are very patient and helpful , and give the hostel a homey feeling', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The rooms are spacious , nice and cosy , good smell , and the beds are super comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I really liked the storage arrangment', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The way there is exposed with no ceiling', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["there ' s only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["Another thing to mind is the location - it ' s about 10 - 15 min", 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['climb up the hill from town', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["It ' s not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

The house in itself is super convenient and if you go to the first floor you can have a wonderful view. There are many comfortable sits that allow you to take a nap while watching those famous rice fields. 2/ The owner, Emma, who can speak English, has been absolutely lovely with me ! She helped me in so many ways and made me feel at home which is a wonderful feeling when you are far away from your country. You can ask her to help you to plan your future destination (call a taxi, car etc….) which is super useful especially in Vietnam. 3/ Everything is super clean : the bathrooms, toilets, kitchen, rooms, beds etc so it feels like you are in a really nice hotel. 4/ The food was delicious so I recommend you to eat there from time to time (the breakfast (I have chosen pancakes) was really good and the cooker prepared the best tomato tofu of my life. ####[['This place looks like paradise on earth', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Moc Home is A Big house , with a pool , and a garden in the most beautiful mountains of Vietnam', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I was shocked about how beautiful the place was', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The owner , Emma , who can speak English , has been absolutely lovely with me !

1743,We had the most wonderful two nights at the viet nhat hotel. Mrs Phuong and Mr Trung were the most lovely hosts we have had during our travels. Both went above and beyond to make our stay more comfortable. We had delicious breakfasts included made by Mrs Phuong, she even gave us free dragon fruit on the side. Mr Trung was so sweet always sharing his fruit with us and when we left sent us off with apples and water bottles. He even drove us to the bus stop because we couldn’t find a grab to take us. Mrs Phuong woke up to let us in when we arrived at 1am and gave us a lovely room. They had an elevator as well which was heaven for us after being up 5 flights of stairs in Hanoi! The room was clean, spacious and had a balcony, TV and refrigerator. The hotel is right opposite the train station so easy to get to. We rented bikes from them for only 100K a day, Mrs Phuong gave me a quick lesson as I hadn’t rode for years. Overall a lovely stay and would recommend to anyone. Hosts so kind, helpful and generous as well as a lovely hotel for such a good price!

1617,Great views. Great location. Awesome pool with swim-up bar. Super comfortable bed. Surprisingly quiet at night. Staff are all amazingly polite, professional, and friendly. Great buffet breakfast options (Eastern and Western). Only a 5-minute walk to the night market. Family friendly. Couple friendly. A little pricey, but it's a luxury resort, so that's to be expected.

105,My family and I had a very comfortable stay at Hanoi Silk Centre hotel. The location is great. It’s in the centre of the old quarter but it’s peaceful and quiet inside. The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place. All the staff are so friendly, especially Ms Karathy and Jay. Ms Karathy booked our transfer from the airport, our trip to Ha Long Bay and was so helpful in making sure everything was sorted before we arrived. Jay made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to help us out. The day of our check out, the staff kindly allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel for the entire day until evening, when we picked up our bags to catch our overnight train to Hue. My dad accidentally left his medication in the hotel room and only realised when we got to the train station. We contacted the hotel and Jay assured us that he and the staff would find it, fortunately, they did find the medication and Jay hopped on his scooter to hand deliver the meds to us at the train station. We were so grateful that he went above and beyond and enabled us to enjoy the rest of our holiday.

I like the location, it's walking distance to the old town, but not on a busy street so it's great that it's quiet and not crowded coming back. there's a water refiller in the hotel so no worries about buying drinking water. bathroom is big and clean. friendly staff who will try to recommended places and answer queries to their best abilities. thank you Helen, Cherry and team! there is no lift, the highest level is 4th floor. not a big prob for me staying at 4th floor since I don't have much luggage. tea and coffee are at ground floor, so it's a bit troublesome to go down just for a drink when there's the dining area at 4th floor. ####[['comfortable stay', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I have requested for early check in and they managed to prepare the room earlier', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["I like the location , it ' s walking distance to the old town", 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["not on a busy street so it ' s great that it ' s quiet and not crowded coming back", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["there ' s a water refiller in the hotel so no worries about buying drinking water", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['bathroom is big and clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['friendly staff who will try to recommended places and answer queries to their best abilities', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['there is no lift', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["tea and coffee are at ground floor , so it ' s a bit troublesome to go down just for a drink when there ' s the dining area at 4th floor", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

274,We stayed in one of the pool villas and it was amazing! It was like a spacious 1 bedroom apartment. The perfect way to end our 4 week stay in Vietnam. The buffet breakfast which was included in the price was without doubt the best we had, so much on offer. The pool was great. And the restaurant Blu Lobster is amazing, we ate there twice. Make sure you watch the sunrise as well, stunning. One small complaint, they were unable to give us a complimentary 2pm checkout, so we booked the hotel shuttle to take us to the airport at 1 for a 3. 45 flight. The man then told us we dont need that much time to be at the airport. And tried pushing us back to 2. We compromised for 1. 45. But had to sit in the lobby bored out of our minds, at least at the airport there are things to look at and we could have got lunch. And I like to mot be rushed at the airport Always go with what you want. Kind of ruined our stay a bit ####[['We stayed in one of the pool villas and it was amazing', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['It was like a spacious 1 bedroom apartment', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The buffet breakfast which was included in the price was without doubt the best we had , so much on offer', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The pool was great', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['And the restaurant Blu Lobster is amazing , we ate there twice', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Make sure you watch the sunrise as well , stunning', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['One small complaint , they were unable to give us a complimentary 2pm checkout , so we booked the hotel shuttle to take us to the airport at 1 for a 3 . 45 flight', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Kind of ruined our stay a bit', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

831,Pool area was really nice, rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable. I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer. Staff very friendly. After ordering a sandwich the bar tender took my payment card away to reception, I presumed to bring a card machine or to swipe my card at reception. There was some misunderstanding and I thought he was asking for my room number but sometime later I got a failed chip and pin attempt notification, he had exceeded the amount of pin attempts and my card was permanently blocked! After several correspondence with my bank about how to unblock it I found out that: The card can only be unblocked in the U. K. For the rest of the trip I was unable to use my card!He probably was trying to provide extra service and be helpful, or maybe it is a cultural difference but in the U. K. no one would ever give their PIN number to someone else, especially a staff member or stranger so we would never even suspect that a member of hotel staff was asking for a PIN number and not a room number. I was annoyed to say the least and even asked them to remove the service charge. At the end they still kept the charge on and I even added somesmall tip because felt bad for the guy who made a mistake, he did also give me a complimentary cola. Though if this happened in Europe at a luxury hotel or resort the sandwich would have lest been complimented in full. Be very careful and never let anyone walk away with your card! I was also fortunate that I had another card still within free withdrawal limits for the trip. ####[['Pool area was really nice , rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Staff very friendly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

1102,New hotel, ok location Quite simply, the hotel lied...about many things. Lie 1) I booked this hotel for my wife's birthday as it has a spa centre, as per the info on their website. There is NO operating spa centre. When I asked about this I was told it was still under construction and that if I wanted to book a spa we can walk around the corner. Lie 2) I'm training for a triathlon so when I saw that the fitness centre is open 24 hours, I thought great! The gym closes at 7pm and is NOT 24 hours. Also, the treadmills don't work. The belt stalls with each step so you can't even walk let alone run. And there are no sanitizing wipes, towels, bins or even access to water. Lie 3) The sunset bar looked great on their website, especially with the snacks and "signature cocktails" noted. There are NO cocktails and no snacks. And what the heck is the point of a pool and bar that closes at 7pm? I kept being told, not enough staff. Lie 4) The restaurant '12 Kitchen' is listed on their website as serving a buffet breakfast and dinner. There is NO dinner served and the breakfast closes at 9:30am. Lie 5) The hotel is listed on booking. com as 5 stars?! I'm not sure on which planet they got this rating but it is a 3 star at best. Definitely not an international standard 5 star. There is also, NO room service and nothing in the mini bar in the rooms. The rooms are ok, but...Upon arrival, the top shelves in the wardrobes were very dusty and we had to wipe them down before using them. The rooms were relatively clean but definitely not to a high standard. Housekeeping staff didn't even wash the glasses on a number of occasions. There is only a kettle with a couple of sachets of coffee issued. The toilets....oh the toilets...if you plan on using anything more than 3 individual squares of toilet paper, be prepared for a blocked toilet.

Surelee, the owner has to change a little bit her attitude. I understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude. Her property, which she named a "homestay", doesn't quite reflect what a homestay should be, since, being Italians and having Italian dishes on the menu, we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused. Also, in my opinion she push to much the customers to purchase her trekking tour which are very expensive compared to the ones found walking by the villages. Finally, the 2 shared bathrooms were not only toilets but also showers, and in the morning they were both constantly busy with people taking showers for hours; it would be good to have a separate toilet in order to avoid the queue ####[['Beautiful woody accommodation in the middle of the nature , with a stunning view of the paddy rice from the second floor balcony', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The Thai food was also very good and cheap', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Surelee , the owner has to change a little bit her attitude', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['I understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Italians and having Italian dishes on the menu , we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['in my opinion she push to much the customers to purchase her trekking tour which are very expensive compared to the ones found walking by the villages', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the 2 shared bathrooms were not only toilets but also showers , and in the morning they were both constantly busy with people taking showers for hours ; it would be good to have a separate toilet in order to avoid the queue', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

The location is a bit out of town which we liked as the centre of Sapa is quite built-up and noisy. It took no more than 10 minutes walk to get to the town centre with many restaurant option son the way. Perfect for us and great value for money.

1965,The place has extremely nice staff. Our feedbacks were always appreciated so the place quality could even be higher in the future. The receptionist gave us many suggestions for good local restaurants. She is kind and patient. The place itself looks new and well-kept. The location was near to Pho Co Hoi An (5-7mins by motorcycle). The price was extremely good with the service we received. There was also breakfast included and the foods were delicious. I hope the property could improve bathroom cleanliness as it could be better in the future. The receptionist area and the breakfast could be quite hot sometimes without AC turning on. Besides this, everything was perfect.

It’s not just giving advise, she also booked motorbike drivers and bus to go to another city for a very cheap price. Her smile and her positive vibe will be stick in my mind.

139010,The food and service staff were all excellent. I found the booking process very irritating, I received several Whats App calls and texts in the days before the cruise from the sales consultant Hang Nga telling me she had a big problem because she had double booked my room, she wanted me to spend one night in a cheaper room then move to my original booked room for the second night. I found her texts to be increasingly bizarre and late at night. She then told me she had a sick child and needed my help. She then offered to buy me a drink in Hanoi if I would just accept her plan to use the cheaper room. She was concerned about her job and realised she had made a big mistake. I was paying a lot of money for this cruise and did not want to move rooms. I told her it was her problem and she would have to fix it. I was traveling with friends and wanted to treat myself to a nice room on this cruise. Her constant texts caused me al lot of unnecessary stress in the days before getting on the cruise. The 2nd day outing wasn't very interesting.

The room has 2 bedrooms and it looks just like new and of course, very clean.

We spent two days comfortably cycling around the area, including Mua Cave and Trang An. Lily offers discounted prices on spa treatments.

1641,Staff were very welcoming and helpful. They upgraded my original room to a slightly bigger one. I liked that you couldn't hear much of the noisy street from inside the room.

1867,The resort was beautiful. Three well-kept pools set in lush greenery next to the beach. You could order food and drink to your loungers at the pool which made it feel extra special. The resort was so quiet during the day, super relaxing! Our only negative was at no fault to Cassia Cottage, but was the noise coming from neighbouring resorts and bars who blasted their music on the beach every night from sunset. It did unfortunately ruin the quiet laid back vibe of Cassia Cottage in the evening. We know this is out of their control, but good to be aware of as we didn’t know how busy the strip of beach was before going. ####[['The resort was beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Three well - kept pools set in lush greenery next to the beach', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['You could order food and drink to your loungers at the pool which made it feel extra special', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The resort was so quiet during the day , super relaxing', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the noise coming from neighbouring resorts and bars who blasted their music on the beach every night from sunset', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['It did unfortunately ruin the quiet laid back vibe of Cassia Cottage in the evening', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

579,All the staff were lovely. In particular Thuy and Ahn. We were made to feel like family and they went out of their way to make our stay more enjoyable. The hotel owner was also lovely, she even gifted us on departure, which is a beautiful and very appreciated gesture .The team of staff are very small and we’re mostly all lovely. The rooms were beautiful and way above the standard of what we paid. Breakfast was good there were both western and plenty of Vietnamese options, but the fruit selection in the morning was always fresh and plentiful. The staff always ask if you want anything special cooked for breakfast and went out of their way to order us yummy pho for breakfast (they don’t usually have this on the menu. The pool is actually bigger than what we expected and was made great use of during the hot Hoi An summer heat . Overall excellent value for money There wasn’t a lot to fault about this hotel. If I have to be picky, it was probably further away from market then we imagined. But it was extremely hot when we were there,and we aren’t game enough for motorcycles, so it may have felt further away then it was . Vihn (I think that’s his name , the only male front concierge) can work on his customer service skills. He could see we were checking out and lots of suitcases, given we had to walk down three flights of stairs, he could have at least offered to assist. He’s probably the worst concierge I’ve dealt with in my time in Vietnam . But he wasn’t enough to ruin my stay.

We had a connecting room but the balcony door did not lock in one of the rooms. And in the night a very strong smell of cigarette smoke wafted through our room through the aircon vent. Someone clearly smoking in their room or near the ducts, it was bad enough to wake us.

139420,The cruise was efficient with nearly everything run on time. The food was of a good standard - with all the meals provided there is very little to worry about. You won’t go hungry either - plenty on offer at all times. The staff were friendly and happy to help throughout our stay. This is true of the guide we had on our second day (of three). We were the only guests to stay on for 2 nights (although note there is always a combination of single and 2 night guests) so our second day was just us - perfect! We had arranged transfers with La Regina and both arrived on time and took us where we needed to go. The room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning (very necessary for Westerners visiting Vietnam in July!), lovely bed and private balcony. All the trips had what we needed to participate too. This is not a romantic or quiet cruise; if you want that, I’d look somewhere else.

77,Beautiful boutique style accommodation. Lovely room fit out, quality decor and accessories, the rooms were very comfortable. The location suited us well. it was in the quiet part of An Bang beach but close enough to lovely homestyle local restaurants, western bars and cafes, convenience stores and a short (cheap) taxi ride to Hoi An. There was a good variety on offer at the breakfast buffet, two swimming pools didn’t feel too busy and the staff were all friendly, responsive and helpful. ####[['Beautiful boutique style accommodation', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Lovely room fit out', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['quality decor and accessories', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the rooms were very comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The location suited us well', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it was in the quiet part of An Bang beach but close enough to lovely homestyle local restaurants , western bars and cafes , convenience stores and a short ( cheap ) taxi ride to Hoi An', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was a good variety on offer at the breakfast buffet', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the staff were all friendly , responsive and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['two swimming pools didn ’ t feel too busy', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL']]
