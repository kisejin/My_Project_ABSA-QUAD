140181,Staff was was super nice and accommodating. We booked the top floor apartment with sea view. Room was large and view was great. Ours was the only room on the top floor, so we essentially had our own private roof top terrace and pool. No issues with family (who are locals) coming and going as we pleased. Cafe downstairs makes great coffee and is open pretty late. We forgot to pay scooter rental at check out but Mr. Tran sent me an email and we settled the outstanding bill upon our return from a side-trip without penalty or other issue. Advertised as having in-room washer, but it did not, although it was still conveniently located in the stairwell in the hallway outside our room, and staff allowed us to use the dryer in the basement. Bathroom door did not stay closed on its own - we had to prop it closed with the garbage can. Bathroom walls could have used a good wipe down, and we noticed some ants in the kitchen area after cooking one night, but they were gone once the room was serviced and the garbage had been removed. They requested cash payment upon check-in although we booked with a card. ####[['Staff was was super nice and accommodating', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Room was large and view was great', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Ours was the only room on the top floor , so we essentially had our own private roof top terrace and pool', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Cafe downstairs makes great coffee and is open pretty late .', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['We forgot to pay scooter rental at check out but Mr .

567,This place is lovely for two main reasons. 1. The staff: Moon, her brother, and the rest of the lovely staff go out of their way to make you feel at home and welcomed. The breakfasts that were prepared were delicious and very fresh. The pool was clean and the perfect size for swimming after a hot day. 2. Location: It is in a more local area which is close to the river and is very peaceful. Convenient if you rent a bike or scooter. The facilities require some maintenance (which is normal given that they had to be closed during the past two years due to COVID). ####[['This place is lovely for two main reasons', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Moon , her brother , and the rest of the lovely staff go out of their way to make you feel at home and welcomed', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The breakfasts that were prepared were delicious and very fresh', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The pool was clean and the perfect size for swimming after a hot day', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['It is in a more local area which is close to the river and is very peaceful', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Convenient if you rent a bike or scooter', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The facilities require some maintenance', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

Also loved that it's across the river from the old town and slightly further down from the night market, so you don't get bothered by loud noises late at night, but yet near enough to walk. ####[["The staff were by far the most kind and caring people I ' ve met in Vietnam so far", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They really took care of me , making sure I was okay as a solo female traveller', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Making sure I ate and giving me fruits of they learned that I skip a meal', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' It was warm and cosy , and felt like I was staying with a family', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ["Also loved that it ' s across the river from the old town and slightly further down from the night market , so you don ' t get bothered by loud noises late at night , but yet near enough to walk", 'Amenity', 'Positive']]

We had a river view bungalow and it was really fantastic to watch all the life floating on the water. Staff and restaurant are not very professional due to lack of English language. But they are working hard and try to improve constantly. The pool and spa area are nice and the rooms are well equipped. Can't imagine to find a better place in the area. The private boat tour we booked was not worth it. There is no more floating market in Cai Be. So if you want to see dirty houses and trash go for ot.

1558,Beautiful open see through lobby, lovely ocean view rooms with a balcony, superb breakfast buffet, wonderful staff and service, and a playroom for the kids with an attendant. The location is perfect, in the city but quieter when compared to the main road area. We ate at the restaurant several times, the seafood buffet was good, a la carte was really good too. The spa was lovely. We were very happy with our stay at Furama. It was great overall, we were very happy with our stay, difficult to find anything wrong. To note, for a family of 2 adults + 2 children, it would make sense to book an ocean view suite rather than take a garden view room. This is because when they say 2 twin beds, it means 2 single beds in the garden room which aren't useful for 2 adults and 2 kids. So you have to take an extra bed at an added cost. Hence for a similar price, take the ocean view room which come with 2 platform sofa's which can convert to 2 kids beds and a fantastic view!

Pool is quite small but in a nice area with sauna and steamroom which you can turn on yourself. Shower / toilet have been built against a huge rock, which makes the area quite unique. The spa upstairs is great, the massage therapists are very good, and one spa treatment is included in the room price. With the free shuttle bus you can go anywhere in the town. Motorbike can be parked in the parking hall. Whoever built the Wind hotels concept knows a lot about excellent customer service and customer retention.

138789,Staff was great and super helpful. Breakfast was good, it was nice that you can order different dishes every morning from the menu on top of the buffet. Location was ok, not that close to old quarter but ok walking distance away. Room was cleaned well, we had a complimentary fruit basket in the room. Surfaces in the room were somewhat worn out, and there was some visible water damage in the bathroom, tiles were cracked etc. You could hear all the noises from the hallway. The walls/windows were so thin, that it felt like the windows were open because the traffic noises were so loud, and it was a little hard to sleep. Update // They asked us to do a written review about the hotel upon check out. We wrote same things on that and here in the booking review. Mostly great things about the service and staff, only complaints was the noises and the fact that the room might need some updates/renovations. We waited in the hotel lobby for a car to pick us up to the airport, and the manager came to us apologizing and they gave us a 50% refund from the car service. We thought that was unnessecary, but it felt nice that they reacted to our feedback. I also wrote this booking review waiting in the lobby, usually I wait to get out of the hotel to do that, I should’ve done it now too. The manager had seen my booking review and came back to talk to us, asking us to change the review from 8 to 10. We felt super uncomfortable that he asked us to do so. We just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. For that point we had nothing but great things to say about the staff, but now it left us with a bad taste to our mouths, and this wasn’t a great ending to our 2-week trip to Vietnam, which had been nothing but lovely so far. I had to lower the grade because we didn’t appreciate this kind of doing. ####[['Staff was great and super helpful .

519,I really liked my stay at Lam Vien Homestay as it was quaint and really comfortable. I adored getting the chance to speak with owner and learn a little more about his and Hue's history. Plus, I arrived so early and they were more accomidating me as I rented a bike and joined one of the other travellers to journey together. My room was ideal, it was on the first floor and had easy access to the bathroom and privacy if wanted. Breakfast and other things were available though I didn't partake as IO have my own dietary means and wanted to see the city which is so full of history and excitement. I finally arrived late in the evening after consuming as much of the wonder that is Hue. I came back to what was supreme quiet and excellent accommodation as I prepared myself some food and go the comfort and quiet of a evening left to my own devices. Being close to both the north and south sides of Hue, I went off to explore as I would leave reasonably early the next morning and was delighted to be so well placed. I really recommend this incredible homestay and encourage you to stay as long as you can because there is so much that makes Hue ideal to travel and experience.

139759,Ideally located (10 minutes walk from Van Long nature reserve - however see negative comments below), exceptionally beautiful and well maintained grounds, excellent breakfast and the dining menu at the restaurant was very good. Rooms are more like private bungalows and were clean and comfortable. The resort, despite it's beautiful trimmings is not good value money - it's actually a greedy money grab. One particular incident left a very sour note for us. The Van Long nature reserve is literally 10 minutes walk away and the normal booking price at the ticketing office for a boatman is 70k per boat. The resort charged us over 200k per person for this "tour" for which all they did was save us the walk by dropping us with their golf cart. Their golf cart driver literally paid the ticketing office the basic fee and dropped us then came back it pick us up. So essentially we paid for the convenience of a 5 minute golf cart ride. I find this extremely greedy. A resort of this of this size should upfront be offering this information and/or even providing this drop off service for free to guests.

Also the close proximity to the airport and free shuttle service for our departure was excellent. The pool area had no staff in attendance through out the day and I had to go down to the lobby to ask for towels to be sent up. Also there was no option to order meals/drinks at lunch time at the pool; as the staff did not start until 4pm. Again I went down to the restaurant in the lobby to ask about getting a meal & drinks sent up to the pool. I was told the only way we could do this was to order room service and take it up to the pool. So we had to return to our room, order our meal then return to the pool. In that time our towels had been removed so had to go get more towels. All this inconvenience could have been fix with either one staff member in attendance at the pool during the day or a telephone at the pool bar with instructions to call & order meals/drinks over the phone.

139603,Location: 300-800m near buses, Co-Op mart, and 10-15 min walk to the main beaches. Personnel: the owner/receptionist is particularly annoying. 1. there is no price list. So she could charge anything, disregarding the Booking's price. if you don't agree she would put you in a small stuffy smoking-smelling room, not as in the picture advertised. You are not allowed to remove the tray. 2. there is no cup/glass, or kettle available to discourage eating or drinking in the room. She had a set mind and tried to rule you as much as possible such as locking away all remote controls in the draw, and telling me that" no need to touch /change them". 3. When I complained about the TV not working and the water from the basin leaking on the bathroom floor, she was very argumentative, trying to put the blame on me. Instead of examining the problems or being willing to fix the issues. She was loud and aggressive and disregarded anything I said or requested persistently. She would never stop talking, once she was in my room. 4. The first day when I arrived I gave her my ID, she did not have any question. After she got to know me in he afternoon, she asked me if I have money to lend her, I laughed and left. When I got back that night I told her that I was very sick. She did not care but kept dragging on questioning my ID , trying to cause me trouble. I was very tired and sick and she would not leave me alone. When I told her that I was willing to pack my bag and leave immediately (eventhough it was almost midnight). She then shut up, and let me go to rest. The next day, the Bell boy asked me nicely if I would stay another day as booked, and tried fixing the leaking basin. So I stayed and She left me alone since. 5. Everyday, room was not cleaned nor rubbished being collected so brought them down to reception bin, she made me to throw them outside the building site. Lastly, I forgot to collect my ID after settling the account. upon realising, I called and asked her nicely to send it to my address in Saigon. ####[['300 - 800m near buses , Co - Op mart , and 10 - 15 min walk to the main beaches', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['he owner / receptionist is particularly annoying', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["there is no price list .

831,Pool area was really nice, rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable. I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer. Staff very friendly. After ordering a sandwich the bar tender took my payment card away to reception, I presumed to bring a card machine or to swipe my card at reception. There was some misunderstanding and I thought he was asking for my room number but sometime later I got a failed chip and pin attempt notification, he had exceeded the amount of pin attempts and my card was permanently blocked! After several correspondence with my bank about how to unblock it I found out that: The card can only be unblocked in the U. K. For the rest of the trip I was unable to use my card!He probably was trying to provide extra service and be helpful, or maybe it is a cultural difference but in the U. K. no one would ever give their PIN number to someone else, especially a staff member or stranger so we would never even suspect that a member of hotel staff was asking for a PIN number and not a room number. I was annoyed to say the least and even asked them to remove the service charge.

975,The bed was solid and comfortable. Rubber flip flop and hairdryer provided. Great location 1min from the beach, 1min from a great variety of restaurants and shops, 20min walking to city centre. The tiled floor in the room looked spotless but under the bed there was all sort of rubbish (incl. a dead cockroach) that would fly around when the window was open. There is just one socket just on one side of the bed. The a/c pointed right at the bed head making very uncomfortable to sleep. The balcony was just 300mm deep, not made to sit outside nor hang your towel after being at the beach. The handrail was totally rusty. The view from every window of the building opens on the rubbish thrown in the perimeter land. The toliet sit is 5fingers smaller than the toilet itself. Shower water runs weak but it works incl. hot water. Very poor breakfast incl. coffee, tea, bread, ham and some fruit. Some staff members din't speak english and they din't make any effort to understand me. Once they knew I was up in the morning, the cleaning staff invaded my room ignoring if I still wanted to stay in the room. It happened to me at 8am. They made the bed pulling the top sheet but leaving the bottom one all messy from your night of sleep. Excluding the entrance hall which looked clean and tidy, the overall condition of the building is dirty and sloppy, uncl. stained carpets and stained table cloths. ####[['The bed was solid and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Rubber flip flop and hairdryer provided', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Great location 1min from the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['1min from a great variety of restaurants and shops , 20min walking to city centre', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The tiled floor in the room looked spotless ', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' under the bed there was all sort of rubbish', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['that would fly around when the window was open', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['There is just one socket just on one side of the bed', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The a / c pointed right at the bed head making very uncomfortable to sleep', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The balcony was just 300mm deep , not made to sit outside nor hang your towel after being at the beach .', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The handrail was totally rusty', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The view from every window of the building opens on the rubbish thrown in the perimeter land', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['The toliet sit is 5fingers smaller than the toilet itself', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Shower water runs weak but it works', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['hot water', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Very poor breakfast incl . coffee , tea , bread , ham and some fruit', 'Service', 'Negative'], [" Some staff members din ' t speak english and they din ' t make any effort to understand me", 'Service', 'Negative'], [' the cleaning staff invaded my room ignoring if I still wanted to stay in the room', 'Service', 'Negative'], [' It happened to me at 8am', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['They made the bed pulling the top sheet but leaving the bottom one all messy from your night of sleep', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the overall condition of the building is dirty and sloppy , uncl . stained carpets and stained table cloths', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the entrance hall which looked clean and tidy', 'Facility', 'Positive']]

However I would recommend the steakhouse. The service is pretty slow at reception I waited seven hours for them to fix my phone in my room. Had to call off my mobile phone several times to remind them and the air con wasn’t working and as no one turned up I ended up having to go down stairs in my pjs to ask for someone to come up. I stayed there this time last year and the service was much better so it’s definitely gone downhill. I spoke to the manager about it and they did let me extend my checkout time for free as compensation.

The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance. Owner stays just next door so it’s easy to reach out if you have any issues provided that she’s at home. Room is comfy and clean. Aircon is a little weak but it works. Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair. Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin. Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin. Owner gave the pin to the metal gate via message through Booking. com’s app but just note that the metal gate is right in front of the apartment on the 5th floor, not the big gate on ground floor facing the street. Since the apartment is located on the 2nd street away from the main road, it’s not too noisy at night. The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries. There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe. The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift. Luckily there is a cement strip laid over the staircase which probably is meant for bicycles but it works fine to roll my small suitcase up. You’re also supposed to pay your room fee upon arrival in cash - which the fault is mine since I didn’t read carefully before booking. So be prepared to bring extra cash, or exchange money in the many shops at the night market. ####[['The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ['Aircon is a little weak but it works', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Room is comfy and clean', 'Facility', 'Positive']]

958,We had 2 rooms with street view. The rooms were a bit musty but once the aircon kicked in it wasn't too bad. Beds are hard and water flows out from shower to toilet room. There is a lift to ground floor but you then need to go down another 2 set of stairs to get to the pool. Not good for people in wheelchairs or with mobility issues. I ended up having to go outside and walk down driveway to get to pool. Repeatedly asked to get mini fridge replaced in one room but they had no idea. Kept saying yes and everyday it still didn't work. Gave up after 3 days. The breakfast was quite good. Had a variety of food for buffet and even on the day they did a la carte there was a good choice. Only a 10 min walk to night market. The pool looked nice and the kids enjoyed it. They do supply a towel for swimming. They need more people that can understand English at the front desk. Not sure I would use it again but it was fairly cheap. The ground floor was in construction and nothing down there, just empty rooms. Reception was on 1st floor.

There were limited options at breakfast, which was just ok. That was not a huge issue, though, because we wanted to explore the food in the city.

The gym is great with good facilities, we had a lovely massage at the spa, and the pool area is gorgeous it’s just such a shame we couldn’t enjoy it as the weather was sadly terrible for entire duration of our stay!

1010,I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential. With its prime location opposite the beach, attentive staff, and impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products, my overall experience was positive. While the hotel showed promise in many aspects, the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay. I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel's recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time. It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences. However, considering the hotel had only been operational for two weeks, this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy. ####[['I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' its prime location opposite the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' attentive staff', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products , my overall experience was positive', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay', 'Service', 'Negative'], [" I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel ' s recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time", 'Service', 'Negative'], [' It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences', 'Service', 'Neutral'], [' this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy', 'Service', 'Neutral']]

274,We stayed in one of the pool villas and it was amazing! It was like a spacious 1 bedroom apartment. The perfect way to end our 4 week stay in Vietnam. The buffet breakfast which was included in the price was without doubt the best we had, so much on offer. The pool was great. And the restaurant Blu Lobster is amazing, we ate there twice. Make sure you watch the sunrise as well, stunning. One small complaint, they were unable to give us a complimentary 2pm checkout, so we booked the hotel shuttle to take us to the airport at 1 for a 3. 45 flight. The man then told us we dont need that much time to be at the airport. And tried pushing us back to 2. We compromised for 1. 45. But had to sit in the lobby bored out of our minds, at least at the airport there are things to look at and we could have got lunch.

139280,We like the location of this hotel. It is very close to the center but not noisy. The staffs are friendly and helpful and they arrange activities like basket boat tour and cooking lessons. If you are staying in this hotel, I highly recommend booking the combined basket boat tour and cooking lessons with Mr Cu. It was fun for us. We were upgraded to the top floor but the room was not clean e. g. candy wrappers from previous guest, mirror is not clean and the bathroom has molds. We asked to be transfered to another room and they did. The next room was okay but I woke up in the middle of the night smelling molds again. I hope they will make some updates of the building. Second, the breakfast is okay but a bit limited. Lastly, we felt that the ladies at the reception are intrusive. For example, the moment we arrived, we just want a rest as we were tired but she was selling us many many things like tours or tailors and repeat many unnecessary information which was annoying for us. They keep asking questions like who is your taxi driver, where are you going, which store?.. I mean, I understand they get some kind of commision but please we are on our holiday and we decide where to buy stuff. On our last day, the lady tried to convinced us to stay one more night in their hotel and beg to give them 10 review which didnt sit well on us. We feel that it is very intrusive and not professional. ####[['We like the location of this hotel .

In my case I didn't have a window - only one to the hall way. The owner is not living at the same place so I had to wait to get instructions about the key code etc. However, that also made it very easy to check-in and out.

138322,This place only cost £13 a night for a double room so it was very cheap for Hanoi. The man behind the desk was helpful. He came up to my room when I couldn't get the air conditioning to work (there is a mains switch you need to turn on before you can use the remote control). He also booked me a taxi for the early hours the next morning to go to the airport, and it was cheaper than Grab. The location is really good, in a side street very close to the historic centre with loads of bars and restaurants on the doorstep. Towels are provided as well as toothbrush, comb, shampoo and shower gel (although it was a whitening one so I avoided). It didn't seem very clean, there were two hairs on the bed that didn't belong to me. The light fittings on the wall were very dusty and one of them didn't work. The bed was not very comfy. The air conditioning did work but the unit looked ancient and it made a lot of noise. The bathroom is in need of replacing, the tiles and taps/shower were all looking very worn/rusty.

1467,This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach. The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach, but since the beach wasn't very busy, you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across. The resort itself is extensive but it doesn't feel too large; it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends, so these times are busy. The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps. There are plenty of beds around that pool and you can have drinks there. The restaurant is good, so spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option. The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration. On the whole, the design of the place is amazing, with plenty of Koi carp ponds, wooden carving, well-maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms. The staffs were amazing and it's really nice to talk to them (thank you Ann!). What has been the best for us was the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil, a nice pool, the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well (Covid had closed that down). It's worth it staying there for a week or more if you're looking for a relaxing pool/beach holiday, but for food you have to either use their restaurant, or use a few local restaurants nearby - or go into town, of course (which you have to as Hoi An is an amazing, but touristy, town!) It's not so much what we didn't like, but maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well. Also, the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient, but the last one back from town is at 17. 30, so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back, which is a bit of a hassle when it gets busy. ####[['This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['the design of the place is amazing , with plenty of Koi carp ponds , wooden carving , well - maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [" The staffs were amazing and it ' s really nice to talk to them", 'Service', 'Positive'], [' the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil , a nice pool , the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [" It ' s worth it staying there for a week or more if you ' re looking for a relaxing pool / beach holiday", 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well', 'Service', 'Neutral'], [' the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient , but the last one back from town is at 17 . 30 , so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The resort itself is extensive', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There are plenty of beds around that pool', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The restaurant is good', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' you can have drinks there', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["the beach wasn ' t very busy , you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across", 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends , so these times are busy', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

They also offered us free breakfast for our entire stay in celebration of reopening after covid. The rooms were squeaky clean and well equipped. The location is central with many eateries and cafes nearby as well as the My Khe beach. Grab food is delivered here at whichever time of the night you want it.

139420,The cruise was efficient with nearly everything run on time. The food was of a good standard - with all the meals provided there is very little to worry about. You won’t go hungry either - plenty on offer at all times. The staff were friendly and happy to help throughout our stay. This is true of the guide we had on our second day (of three). We were the only guests to stay on for 2 nights (although note there is always a combination of single and 2 night guests) so our second day was just us - perfect! We had arranged transfers with La Regina and both arrived on time and took us where we needed to go. The room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning (very necessary for Westerners visiting Vietnam in July!), lovely bed and private balcony. All the trips had what we needed to participate too. This is not a romantic or quiet cruise; if you want that, I’d look somewhere else. The boat was full when we went and most of the other guests were quiet loud Vietnamese on holiday (it may differ at other times of the year). Personally, we don’t like timetables / schedules so didn’t warm to the frequent announcements but we did get all the activities we were promised. We didn’t get the “welcome drinks” mentioned in the original information but a minor thing. ####[['everything run on time', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The food was of a good standard - with all the meals provided there is very little to worry about', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The staff were friendly and happy to help throughout our stay', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['We had arranged transfers with La Regina and both arrived on time and took us where we needed to go', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning ', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['lovely bed and private balcony', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['We didn ’ t get the “ welcome drinks ” mentioned in the original information', 'Branding', 'Negative']]

1102,New hotel, ok location Quite simply, the hotel lied...about many things. Lie 1) I booked this hotel for my wife's birthday as it has a spa centre, as per the info on their website. There is NO operating spa centre. When I asked about this I was told it was still under construction and that if I wanted to book a spa we can walk around the corner. Lie 2) I'm training for a triathlon so when I saw that the fitness centre is open 24 hours, I thought great! The gym closes at 7pm and is NOT 24 hours. Also, the treadmills don't work. The belt stalls with each step so you can't even walk let alone run. And there are no sanitizing wipes, towels, bins or even access to water. Lie 3) The sunset bar looked great on their website, especially with the snacks and "signature cocktails" noted. There are NO cocktails and no snacks. And what the heck is the point of a pool and bar that closes at 7pm? I kept being told, not enough staff. Lie 4) The restaurant '12 Kitchen' is listed on their website as serving a buffet breakfast and dinner. There is NO dinner served and the breakfast closes at 9:30am. Lie 5) The hotel is listed on booking. com as 5 stars?! I'm not sure on which planet they got this rating but it is a 3 star at best. Definitely not an international standard 5 star. There is also, NO room service and nothing in the mini bar in the rooms. The rooms are ok, but...Upon arrival, the top shelves in the wardrobes were very dusty and we had to wipe them down before using them. The rooms were relatively clean but definitely not to a high standard. Housekeeping staff didn't even wash the glasses on a number of occasions. There is only a kettle with a couple of sachets of coffee issued. The toilets....oh the toilets...if you plan on using anything more than 3 individual squares of toilet paper, be prepared for a blocked toilet.

139021,Ideal Homestay to get out of the crowds. The son speaks English, the parents do not, but they are sweethearts. Always willing to help and smiling. The beach is at 10 min walk and 3 in the motorcycle. If you rent one they'll let you park it inside the homestay. It's possible to wake up every morning and swim in the ocean (I did). You can order your breakfast (made to order), go to the beach, swim and when you come back, it's waiting for you in the room, where you can enjoy it in the spacious AC Room. I was able to leave my heavy luggage with them for 3 days, at no charge, I recommend tipping though, this is a true Homestay (they live next door), they are building it up based on our visits. Quiet and a breath of fresh air (ironically in a superhot & humid weather) compared to downtown Hoi An. 15min motorcycle ride through an amazing landscape (see photos). You can find better? probably (closer to the beach... i saw a couple of places, but it's hard to beat the value.

139250,The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture. There were ample electrical socketss. The bathroom and plumbing was quite good. The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy. There was plenty of parking near the gate. There was easy access to a lovely clean beach, direct from the resort. There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures. it was surrounded by trees giving ample shade to the loungers. The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view. There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure, Napoli being the best. We have used this one many times in the past. There are some small local shops ( kiosks) for basic needs. The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer. Not much! Like a lot of the resorts here, they suffer from a lack of customers during covid so have an air of being a bit run-down. However the faults were minor and did not detract from our stay. The restaurant only had a partial service due to lack of customers. There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning, when the resort filled up for the weekend. At other times there was a limited menu. There wasn't anywhere to hang wet clothes after, say, a swim and nothing to sit on outside. ####[['The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There were ample electrical socketss', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The bathroom and plumbing was quite good', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There was plenty of parking near the gate', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There was easy access to a lovely clean beach , direct from the resort', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure , Napoli being the best', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There are some small local shops ( kiosks ) for basic needs', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning , when the resort filled up for the weekend', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['At other times there was a limited menu', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["There wasn ' t anywhere to hang wet clothes after , say , a swim and nothing to sit on outside", 'Facility', 'Negative']]

1407,The boat itself is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay. It feels magical. The staff were extremely kind and welcoming. We did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized. Kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in Vietnam. All the food was quite good and was included. But, FYI if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise. The staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood. The baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window, so you can look out at the bay, which is great. This ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay. The balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures. No drinks are included and although they have a buy 2 get 1 free happy hour, the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying it would be nice if they were included. On the last day as well we went on the tour to the caves on the bamboo boats, which was great to see. However, there was very little time after the tour before checkout to shower or pack and it felt quite rushed. ####[['The boat itself is absolutely beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['It feels magical', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The staff were extremely kind and welcoming', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['We did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in Vietnam', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['All the food was quite good and was included', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' The baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['you can look out at the bay , which is great', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['This ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['The balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' No drinks are included', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['it would be nice if they were included', 'Service', 'Neutral'], [' On the last day as well we went on the tour to the caves on the bamboo boats , which was great to see .', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' there was very little time after the tour before checkout to shower or pack and it felt quite rushed', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

138323,absolutely gorgeous, even better in real life - felt like a boutique-y four seasons. the bar on the top floor was beautiful and all of the food at the restaurant fantastic. whoever designed or built the hotel is clearly a world traveler with impeccable taste. gym was really nice too (did not take advantage of the spa) service was great except at the pool - constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the (quite large) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don’t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down. It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting, you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes. Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment, you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot (or didn’t understand because of language barrier?). Then by then the food is cold. Frequently saw 2-3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention. Also, the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours (this was a Monday afternoon) stirring up lots of insects. Why isn’t this done early morning or evening when there are less people trying to enjoy the pool? If it weren’t for the pool experience being unpleasant, I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation. Because of this, I don’t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn’t enjoyable to sit by the pool. But we still would come back for the rooms, gym and food. ####[['absolutely gorgeous , even better in real life', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' all of the food at the restaurant fantastic', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['the bar on the top floor was beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['felt like a boutique - y four seasons', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['gym was really nice too', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['service was great except at the pool', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the ( quite large ) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don ’ t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting , you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment , you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Then by then the food is cold', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Frequently saw 2 - 3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['stirring up lots of insects', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['I don ’ t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn ’ t enjoyable to sit by the pool', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['But we still would come back for the rooms , gym and food', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['If it weren ’ t for the pool experience being unpleasant , I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation', 'Branding', 'Neutral']]

The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area. The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more. The homestay itself is cute and homely, with a small shared living space that you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions. The rooms are located just behind a little stream at the back and provides total quietness. Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them! We stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view. Internet is great and we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us. It was such a lovely place to get away from HCMC for a few days. It is a great value for price! The only inconvenience (that can be easily rectified) is that as it is in the outskirt of Ben Tre you cannot reach there by public transport from HCMC. The small taxi rides are absolutely worth being in the quietness and lush green surroundings! ####[['It is located on the quieter side of the river', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The homestay itself is cute and homely , with a small shared living space', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them !

1137,The location in the Old Quarter was fantastic and close to everything. The street at the front of the hotel is closed at the weekend, so you may struggle to be dropped outside. This really isn't a problem! All staff were fantastic. There are so many trips and variations on offer and so it was difficult to know what was best for the budget. We listened to Mai's advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted. Everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back. For trips to Sapa, I would recommend the individual cabin on the bus as this was a godsend after such a long walk, try to get the cabin near the front as the ride is smoother and take mosquito spray. Travelling with children, Mai made this much more relaxed! We would recommend the Met restaurant close to the hotel. ####[['The location in the Old Quarter was fantastic and close to everything', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The street at the front of the hotel is closed at the weekend , so you may struggle to be dropped outside', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['All staff were fantastic', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["We listened to Mai ' s advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted", 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back', 'Service', 'Positive']]

139620,The location is central, there is a supermarket nearby, nice Banh-Mi-Stands around the corner and a coffee shop closeby (E-Coffee). There were toilet amenities (soap, TP, toothbrush). The AC was working and quiet. We booked this hotel. We arrived after a long journey, and a sign was saying: we send you a message with all booking infos to self check-in. Said message never arrived. I contacted the responsible, who was quick to answer: we have issues with the climate control we have to rebook you to another location. That's how we got to Supertramp. Funny thing: it happened to another lady while we were there and she told us they rebooked her because the other one was full. This hotel looks way nicer than the other - which is why we think it's a scam. Now, reading other reviews, I realized it happened before. Coming to Supertramp:It's a construction site!At first we got offered a room with no window, which was not what we booked. They showed us another room, which we took. The room contained a kitchen and a washing-maschine (both not working) and a bed. The room was so tiny that we couldn't put our bags on the ground. Why do you put a not functioning kitchen+machine if there is no space already?!The cupboards were moist, some dirty towels were roting in them. The room was dirty. I made the mistake of looking behind the bed and in the cupboard - so much dirt, dust and spiderwebs. The walls are quite thin and not soundproof, so we heard everything (from neighbors to elevator and construction work).We wanted to pay online, but they didn't accept it: only cash. As we just arrived, we didn't have VND yet and explained that we would contact them as soon as we did and pay the bill. We stayed 3 days. Within the first day we got contacted 3 times to ask for the money (even though we previously made an agreement). In the end we got woken up by a random lady the next morning at 8a. m (she wouldn't stop knocking, spoke no English, just said "money,money". Nobody told us she would come and wake us up.

362,a lovely spot out of the craziness of the old town. only a $2NZD taxi ride to town for a little respite from the bustle and noise. very clean and well serviced with staff who are knowledgeable and very keen to help. we were there during an unseasonable hot spell but the pool was not temperature controlled so it was not very refreshing after being out for the day in +35 degrees. it may be temperature controlled during the high season? ####[['a lovely spot out of the craziness of the old town', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['only a $ 2NZD taxi ride to town for a little respite from the bustle and noise', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['very clean', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['well serviced with staff who are knowledgeable and very keen to help', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['we were there during an unseasonable hot spell but the pool was not temperature controlled so it was not very refreshing after being out for the day in + 35 degrees', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' it may be temperature controlled during the high season', 'Facility', 'Neutral']]

1867,The resort was beautiful. Three well-kept pools set in lush greenery next to the beach. You could order food and drink to your loungers at the pool which made it feel extra special. The resort was so quiet during the day, super relaxing! Our only negative was at no fault to Cassia Cottage, but was the noise coming from neighbouring resorts and bars who blasted their music on the beach every night from sunset. It did unfortunately ruin the quiet laid back vibe of Cassia Cottage in the evening. We know this is out of their control, but good to be aware of as we didn’t know how busy the strip of beach was before going. ####[['The resort was beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Three well - kept pools set in lush greenery next to the beach', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['You could order food and drink to your loungers at the pool which made it feel extra special', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The resort was so quiet during the day , super relaxing', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' the noise coming from neighbouring resorts and bars who blasted their music on the beach every night from sunset', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' It did unfortunately ruin the quiet laid back vibe of Cassia Cottage in the evening', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

1516,This is a cozy family home that has everything you need. Don't expect anything too fancy though. As a solo travel who usually stays at hostels, it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel. The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening. The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I've stayed at. Bathroom was shared but was always empty. The private room also locks. Everything I could ask for! Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market. The stairs inside the home are a little challenging. The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small (I had to navigate them going down with my feet sideways). Fortunately, my room was on the first level above ground, but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you. Also, finding the apartment was a little tricky. Finding the address of the building was fine. Take the concrete stairs up a flight and go down the first hall to your right. There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it's easy to miss. I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end, but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn't confirm if I was at the right place. I left but ended up being redirected back to the apartment. The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English. The whole family is lovely, but it can be hard to find the apartment. ####[['This is a cozy family home that has everything you need', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening', 'Service', 'Positive'], [" The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I ' ve stayed at", 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Bathroom was shared but was always empty', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The private room also locks', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Everything I could ask for', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' The stairs inside the home are a little challenging', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' finding the apartment was a little tricky', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['my room was on the first level above ground , but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['The whole family is lovely', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' it can be hard to find the apartment', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [" I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end , but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn ' t confirm if I was at the right place", 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it ' s easy to miss", 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

140115,the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish, the owner and the staff generally polite, friendly and helpful. i was offered free tea during check-in and check-out. good communication via whatsapp, the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in. on arrival my scooter was brought to a safe place and they also took care of my keys and gear. Unfortunately there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds. On arrival I was warned of the nocturnal noise from the street - to be fair, before paying. However, the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs, even the mattress vibrated (and that was on the 4th floor, not directly at the street and on a tuesday) - not the hotels fault, but guests should be aware of this. After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff, they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel (30k) saying it couldn't be reused anymore (!). after i asked if it's possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away, they wanted to bill me for 200k. I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet. i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules. ####[['the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' the owner and the staff generally polite , friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['i was offered free tea during check - in and check - out', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['good communication via whatsapp , the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff , they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel ( 30k ) saying it couldn ' t be reused anymore ", 'Service', 'Negative'], [" i asked if it ' s possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away , they wanted to bill me for 200k", 'Service', 'Negative'], [' I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules', 'Service', 'Negative']]

The owners of the hotel, a sweet pair of aunty and uncle, tried to make up for it by packing a small picnic for our Mua Cave visit.

140057,Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely, airy, clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea. The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city, particularly at night. The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter's birthday (highly recommend for a fun afternoon/evening) Breakfast is great in the hotel, but there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about. Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night. Be prepared though as it was very busy on all the surrounding streets, so if you don't like crowds, you'll have to see the fire-breathing from a distance !! This is isn't a criticism of the hotel, but be aware there is a lot of development going on in Da Nang and lots of construction site. On one of the days there was a lot of drilling and banging coming from a nearby site and there is a stage on the beach directly below the hotel that plays loud music most night until 11pm. Also be prepared for noise form the street outside (tooting of horns, etc) and also the fact the beach is packed at 5. 30am with people watching the sunrise. None of these things can be controlled by the hotel though and they didn't detract from our stay. In short, if you want peace and quiet Da Nang is probably not the place for you.... ####[['Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely , airy , clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city , particularly at night', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter ' s birthday ", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast is great in the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

140080,The location of the hotel is excellent. Although It is only away from the "Hồ Hoàn Kiếm" (Lake) only 3 streets, the hotel is not noisy. One of the best things is the service and hospitality. When we arrived to the hotel and ready to check-in, the front-desk staff served us with pineapple ginseng tea and sweets. The whole check-in process was very smoothly and in-order. Another advantage is the breakfast, every morning we enjoyed very good breakfast with many choice (Western, French, Vietnamese), The staff always show very polite and friendly hospitality. We often spent over one hour to having breakfast in the restaurant. The quality of the room is excellent, Although my room was not very large, it is very clear and provided with drinks, coffee and tea bags and fruits. During the Lunar new year holiday, Hotel celebrated the new year with the Red packet and biscuits! Also, we could book the transportation to the airport, all payment can be settled in the front-desk. The price is fair. The staff could confirm everything with us the date before our departure. Generally speaking, the quality of the service is excellent, I could say the hotel is one of the best in Hanoi. We enjoyed the holiday there and I highly recommended this hotel to everyone!

139817,Beautiful woody accommodation in the middle of the nature, with a stunning view of the paddy rice from the second floor balcony. The Thai food was also very good and cheap! Surelee, the owner has to change a little bit her attitude. I understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude. Her property, which she named a "homestay", doesn't quite reflect what a homestay should be, since, being Italians and having Italian dishes on the menu, we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused. Also, in my opinion she push to much the customers to purchase her trekking tour which are very expensive compared to the ones found walking by the villages. Finally, the 2 shared bathrooms were not only toilets but also showers, and in the morning they were both constantly busy with people taking showers for hours; it would be good to have a separate toilet in order to avoid the queue ####[['Beautiful woody accommodation in the middle of the nature , with a stunning view of the paddy rice from the second floor balcony', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The Thai food was also very good and cheap', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Surelee , the owner has to change a little bit her attitude', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['I understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Italians and having Italian dishes on the menu , we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['in my opinion she push to much the customers to purchase her trekking tour which are very expensive compared to the ones found walking by the villages', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the 2 shared bathrooms were not only toilets but also showers , and in the morning they were both constantly busy with people taking showers for hours ; it would be good to have a separate toilet in order to avoid the queue', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

890,The staff at the Solaria Hotel were absolutely wonderful, everyone was kind, helpful and friendly. The room (401) was at the front of the hotel with a french balcony overlooking the road, but as it was in the old quarter of the city this is normal. The reception area was comfortable, the dining room on floor 8 was bright and airy and breakfast had a good choice of fruit, yogurt, pastries and bread and a choice of cooked eggs. We had an evening meal after a long day out and it was exceptional, lots of menu choices, beautifully presented and very delicious. The hotel explains that whilst it is in a convenient part of the city, the views and space are not as good as the larger hotels but it makes up for that by providing excellent care and dedication and believe me that is exactly what they do. Nothing is too much trouble and all the staff go the extra mile to make your stay pleasurable.

Also, on booking. com the address is wrong (correct address as of 4/23 is Alley 1/5A, Đường Lê Hồng Phong, Phường 4, Thành phố Đà Lạt, Lâm Đồng, Vietnam) which meant that I showed up to the old hostel address at 4:30 in the morning.

139569,We arrived late to this charming hotel, check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade. Our room was well appointed, just as pictured in the photos with a very comfortable bed. In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields. Both the ladies at reception, Xí and Vân, took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind. From helping us book taxis, tours (we booked Golden Bridge), laundry services, massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning, they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional. They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight! This hotel is located halfway between An Bang Beach and Hoi An Old Town, in a peaceful, tranquil rural setting. It’s ideally situated for day trips like basket boat tours and even Tra Que Culinary Village. We loved being able to see the farmers work the land in this authentic setting and walking to nearby little cafés. We used the free bicycles to explore the area a few times, which was very pleasant. It would be a quick 10-15 minute bike ride into town. The pool was a little too cold for us during our one week stay in February, but it was still lovely to sit around on the comfy loungers and listen to the trickling water, like a little oasis. The gentleman who works on the grounds doesn’t speak English, but he works very hard to maintain the property, is the hotel’s security, gardener and I’m sure whatever else needs doing. Our hats off to him! We Canadians highly recommend this little gem of a hotel just outside the busy area. We’d like to thank the staff at Maison Fleur Hoi An for a wonderful stay! Occasionally we had to be patient to get a Grab taxi to come and pick us up at the property as it's a little out of the way. But this is also part of why we liked the hotel. ####[['check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Our room was well appointed', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' just as pictured in the photos', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Both the ladies at reception , Xí and Vân , took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['From helping us book taxis , tours ( we booked Golden Bridge ), laundry services , massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning , they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight !

Location was good - lots of food options and cafes around, not too far from the heart of D1 (via Grabcar/Grabbike). Internet was reliable. The room (double room with private bathroom) was EXTREMELY noisy - and this is coming someone who isn't very sensitive to noise/can sleep almost everywhere. I understand it's impossible for it to be completely quiet as the room faces the street and is opposite a school but better windows really need to be installed or, at the very least, thicker velvet curtains that would keep the sound out. On top of that, there was a hole in the upper pane of balcony doors. I didn't mind this so much but I know this is important to some people - the water pressure in the shower is weak. ####[['The room itself was very spacious - seating area with sofa , bed , dining table , pantry area , bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Basic toiletries and towels were provided', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Location was good - lots of food options and cafes around , not too far from the heart of D1', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Internet was reliable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['was EXTREMELY noisy', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['windows really need to be installed or , at the very least , thicker velvet curtains that would keep the sound out', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['there was a hole in the upper pane of balcony doors', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the water pressure in the shower is weak', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' the room faces the street and is opposite a school', 'Amenity', 'Negative']]

1232,Our room was great- large, all wood, with a balcony facing the valley and a hot tub in the bathroom. Staff were super friendly and helpful. It was a positive that the lodge was out of the city of Sa Pa, giving us lots of peace and quiet. The lodge restaurant served a wide variety of dishes and the quality was very good. It's a bit costly to get from the hotel to the town of Sa Pa - about $9 each way in taxi and although the lodge has a good view of the valley, it is built right on a main road. Can't say enough about how friendly and helpful staff were, but the level of English was often poor, and thus getting answers to questions about sites to visit, places to go, and things to do, were often confusing and contradictory. ####[['Our room was great - large , all wood , with a balcony facing the valley and a hot tub in the bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Staff were super friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['It was a positive that the lodge was out of the city of Sa Pa , giving us lots of peace and quiet', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The lodge restaurant served a wide variety of dishes and the quality was very good', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["It ' s a bit costly to get from the hotel to the town of Sa Pa - about $ 9 each way in taxi", 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' the lodge has a good view of the valley', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['it is built right on a main road', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [" Can ' t say enough about how friendly and helpful staff were", 'Service', 'Positive'], [' but the level of English was often poor', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['and thus getting answers to questions about sites to visit , places to go , and things to do , were often confusing and contradictory', 'Service', 'Negative']]

138594,The hotel itself and the staff deserve a five star rating. The facilities of the hotel, the interior design, the standard of the rooms are high class.

The restaurant on the basement floor offers a huge breakfast buffet, western and Asian style plus a menue. Lunch and dinner has separate menue with various dishes at reasonable prices. Service is attentive and especially at breakfast there is no request they wouldn't satisfy. Even for breakfast they ask for your allergies! There is a rooftop bar with happy hour and a view from the 5th floor. The other bar is in the lobby. My room offered much more than I expected: apart from safe, TV, hairdryer and water kettle, there is a fridge, free water, tea, coffee and fruits. The bed is so comfortable you don't want to get out, as is the linen and towels from very good quality. Enough plugs to recharge your electronic equipment. Lights are also good and enough.

It's worth noting that two of the dogs are very friendly and like being petted, but two of them are not.

1582,Helpfull staff, great location, really nice facilities. The lady behind the counter in the breakfast restaurant makes a great omelette. The rooftop bar and pool are one big reason to stay here. The view from the pool is breathtaking, the staff really helpful and as a bonus during really hot days: the pool is in the shade of the 22nd floor in the afternoon. The beach view rooms come with one little drawback: music playing through the night on the beach audible even on the higher floors with windows closed. For guests with light sleep, city view might be a good consideration (not a bad view anyhow - see photo). Closing time of the rooftop bar at 22:00 is something guests have to count with.

139112,We purposely chose Sapa Clayhouse as the finale of our Vietnam trip and it was such a treat for us. We booked the executive suite. Everything inside the room was perfect. We went in mid December their winter season, and we were pleasantly surprised that the bed was heated. The decor and furnishings of the entire place were tastefully done up too, so pretty that we requested to buy some vases as souvenirs. The staffs were all very professional and polite. Food was really good too, everything we ordered was a hit. And try their signature house cocktail mix it was so good! Highly highly highly recommend to make this place your last stop in Sapa. We were a little shocked that the housekeeping team actually went into our room to clean up while we were at the dining area having our meal. It was a nice and attentive gesture but would appreciate the option for us to choose if we want the service or not, as for our personal preference, we prefer not to have housekeeping service during our stay to prevent any mishaps. But overall the stay totally exceeded my expectations I highly recommend it. ####[['We purposely chose Sapa Clayhouse as the finale of our Vietnam trip and it was such a treat for us', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Everything inside the room was perfect', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['we were pleasantly surprised that the bed was heated', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' The decor and furnishings of the entire place were tastefully done up too', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The staffs were all very professional and polite', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Food was really good too , everything we ordered was a hit', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Highly highly highly recommend to make this place your last stop in Sapa', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], [' We were a little shocked that the housekeeping team actually went into our room to clean up while we were at the dining area having our meal .

The description and facilities of the hotel listing matches up and everything is in perfect working order, including the gym and the pool. The room was cleaned to an amazing standard and the lobby, dining area, pool and gym were always spotless. There are free bikes to use at the hotel which we loved and took them to Old Town and discovered the local area. The staff are on hand 24/7 to help out and even have a Whats App if you need their assistance whilst out etc. If you need anything the staff are happy to help. Ms. Kim was super helpful and gave us so many recommendations on local cuisine, activities and shows and also assisted in booking us tickets. We loved how the breakfast was freshly made and the staff kindly accommodated my allergies. There are several local options and amazing fresh fruit too. We will definitely be back and we recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Hoi An - you will receive the best hospitality experience!!

Also, you have to do the vegan cooking class and meditation with Lisa and Yong (one of our favorite memories), available on air bnb.

The location isn't perfect. While it's a stones through away from the harbour, it is a 10 minute walk up a hill then down a hill into the town.

Decent place to work as well, because of the good Wi Fi. The price was amazing. Really incredibly cheap for what you get. The bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet, there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed, the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area. I'm not sure if it was a residential building as well, but there was a family staying on our floor that had two rooms, and left the door open between them, yelling very loudly in the hallway at all hours. Overall it was just not relaxing or comfortable. I can't hold anything against the staff, but my experience here was dreadful. I'm sorry. But I do hope my feedback goes somewhere, since there are positive aspects to the hotel too. ####[[' the staff are pretty nice', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The shower is big and the water pressure is good', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Decent place to work as well , because of the good Wi Fi', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The hotel itself is quite a nice looking building', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The price was amazing', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Really incredibly cheap for what you get', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet , there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['Overall it was just not relaxing or comfortable', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['my experience here was dreadful', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["I can ' t hold anything against the staff", 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['since there are positive aspects to the hotel too', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ["I ' m not sure if it was a residential building as well , but there was a family staying on our floor that had two rooms , and left the door open between them , yelling very loudly in the hallway at all hours", 'Experience', 'Negative']]

Free bicycles are available, as well as motorbikes for 100k/day + gas price. Transport service to the train station was easily arranged by Tuan.

He calls you cabs, rents you bikes, changes money cheaply and get you sim cards. Its a hotel but also a one stop for all your needs becuase they really care about you having the best time possible. I cannot speak highly enough of my experience there with them. I had a balcony room, it was very clean, serviced each day I was there and everything worked as I should have. If you are looking to rent a place in the heart of old quarter, which is within walking distance of a lot of things to do, then this is definitely the place to go!

183,The staff were friendly and helpful. The location is good, the beach is 5 minutes on foot away and there's plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. It's quite cheap. The mattress in the room was horrible. There was a huge dent in the center. At the time the hotel was being renovated, so maybe they would have changed it out, but I think they didn't. The room I stayed in had no window, so it was quite stuffy, but that was expected for the price. I peeped into a renovated higher end room on that floor (the door was open because of the construction), and it looked pretty good. The fridge didn't work (no cooling effect whatsoever) and the little bottles of shower gel and shampoo in the shower seemed to all be missing the little straws inside so you cannot really use the pump on it, which was weird?!The landromat was expensive: 120. 000vnd (or more) for a load of clothes. I literally paid a quarter of that for the same load in Hanoi's Old quarter.

A clean and comfy couch was very welcome after 4 hours on a motorbike in 36+ deg heat riding across the red river delta.

The AC was so good it dried our clothes over night as it rained outside. The samsung washing machine was an excellent feature and the staff kindly gifted us some laundry liquid. The rest of the bathroom was well equipped and clean. The bed was comfortable and extra wide. The entire apartment was very clean and offered sweeping views across downtown Haiphong. Breakfast is a buffet with made to order Banh Da Cua (crab noodle soup) and eggs plus all the other bits you want, and great coffee.

Our room had absolutely nothing to do with the pictures! Ask them to show you the room at least before paying. It was DISGUSTING staying at this place, such an overpiced hotel!

421,Incredibly comfortable bed. Great location. Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements. Preface: Their claim is "Beyond Perfection" and it is marketed as a "Luxury Boutique" 5 star hotel. While beautifully designed, many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience (function of light switches, relative position of shower and towel for maximum water coverage of said towels, maintenance work during check-out hours) and some elements already are showing wear and tear. For a 5 star hotel, the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training, with very odd formalities that were unnecessary, poorly executed, or just awkward. We also received a phone call to our room at 4:48am, which was a mistake by reception. When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves. (The manager did reimbursed us for transport when it was brought to her attention) The cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed. Known classics were watered down and almost unrecognisable in their taste. ####[['Incredibly comfortable bed', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Great location', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['beautifully designed', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['some elements already are showing wear and tear', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['For a 5 star hotel , the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training , with very odd formalities that were unnecessary , poorly executed , or just awkward', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['We also received a phone call to our room at 4 : 48am , which was a mistake by reception', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Known classics were watered down and almost unrecognisable in their taste', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed', 'Service', 'Negative']]

139427,Sapa garden is a little oasis of beauty about 2 kilometers outside of Sapa center. The rooms are comfortable and big, (we were in the Kings room with a balcony.) The property offers several breakfast options including eggs, pancakes or yogurt and fruit. They also do dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed a menu of chicken stir-fry, shrimp stir-fry and spring rolls at the property. Much better quality than the dinner we had in Sapa. But the gem is the gardens surrounding the property, they are absolutely stunning. There are several sitting areas to enjoy a glass of wine in the evening. In addition the staff is very helpful and accommodating. Mr. Nam Hong can arrange a guide for treks in the area and tickets for Fansipan mountain. Laundry service is also available.

138760,The pool was nice. The location (close to the night market) was also good. I would really not recommend this hotel. We are by no means picky people and have travelled extensively, but this is one of the worst hotels we have ever encountered in terms of price/quality. The room was not cleaned before our arrival (two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it, thus also no clean towels. The place did not only have cockroaches upon arrival, but we kept encountering them. Although we know this might just be the climate, we did not encounter them anywhere else during 3 weeks in Vietnam. The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up, which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm. The water pressure was almost non existent. The airconditioning did not work most of the time. Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible. The staff did not speak a word of English. We had to communicate via Google translate. Overall, this place calls itself a resort, but in comparison with some of the significantly lower priced homestays or other hotels we had throughout three weeks in Vietnam, we would barely call this place a hotel and definitely not a resort. The sun was not present during our 3 days in Phu Quoc, but the 'cosy' part of 'suncosy' was even more absent than the sun. ####[['The pool was nice', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' The location ( close to the night market ) was also good', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['I would really not recommend this hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['The room was not cleaned before our arrival ( two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom ), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it , thus also no clean towels', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up , which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' The water pressure was almost non existent .', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The airconditioning did not work most of the time', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The staff did not speak a word of English .

1408,The location of this hostel is good, about a 10 minute motorbike ride from the beach and there are some lovely local bars, restaurants and tailors in the surrounding area as well. The staff were pleasant and friendly, with good recommendations and great English skills. They switched us to a different room quickly and without a hassle when my friend and I didn't want to share our hostel room with loud guests. This hostel is very dominated by English backpackers and so it caters to a very party/drinking oriented crowd, so if this is not what you're looking for this is probably not the place for you. While the pool is a nice addition, it's rather small. The breakfast provided was really lacking variety though, and what they did have was not very nice. We were also given stained towels to use and when we asked for new ones they were stained as well.

By far the most exceptional part of the experience was the staff, who went above and beyond to make our stay special. They even surprised me with a birthday cake and sang happy birthday to me at dinner! And they also decorated our room with rose petals and a hand-written card. So special!

138437,This was our best accomodation in Vietnam. There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses. There are small pools with fish and water flowers, it is like in a fairy-tale. I really recommend the place. Our bathroom was in the back of the house, outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle. Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also. We arrived in february and the weather was perfect. Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area. This is perfect for nature lovers. The room itself was clean and spacious. Clean towels and linen. The young ladies at the reception are welkoming and very helpful with everything you need. They organised transportation, help with motorcicle or motorbike rental, offer info and help with everything. They are very kind. They organised us the boat tour to floating market and arranged us the transportation to their places and then to the airport in Can Tho based on our group needs. Excellent comunication with them. The place is in the rural area near Can Tho so it is interesting to explore the villages by bicicle and see how people live, make an idea of how the life in around water canals. There is a local-style minimarket at walking distance from the accomodation. If you dont ride bicicle or motorbike the area might look a bit remote. We found no other place to eat at walking distance but we reached a small town at 6 km of bicicle ride with the help of google maps where you can find everything. We bought some exotic interesting fruits there in the fruit market and brought them at the accomodation and enjoyed them in the eating area. The boat tour on the canals and at the floating market revealed a lot of pollution. Plastic waste floating everywhere. It is very sad to see that. Otherwise it is interesting to see the trade at the floating market. ####[['This was our best accomodation in Vietnam', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['There are small pools with fish and water flowers , it is like in a fairy - tale', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I really recommend the place', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['Our bathroom was in the back of the house , outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area .

Although I had no breakfast included in my booking, the hotel prepared a huge take away breakfast as I had an 6. 30 am pick up to Sapa, Before arriving to Vietnam I wanted to arrange a trip to Sapa as I had limited time in Vietnam. I was struggling to find something on the internet. The hotel connected me to the tour desk and Ian was amazing. He answered all my questions and advised the best options for my limited time. He customised a trip to Sapa with my own guide and arrange an excellent hotel there as well. Fantastic location in the heart of old quarter. 5 minutes walk to everything and still very quiet.

1546,Location was convenient and staff were really helpful and friendly. We stayed in room 109 which was a family room. The room was extremely dark as our window looked out onto a wall and a roof top with broken air conditioner units on. We booked a family room as we were travelling with our teenage son - house keeping did not replace or restock shower gel, towels or bathroom mats during out 3 night stay. They took the dirty towels away without replacing new ones. I had to constantly ask house keeping to replace our towels. The room was dusty and there were lots of small insects in the room. No counter space in the bathroom to leave toiletries. Limited hanging space/hooks to hang wet towels. Very poor for a family room. Breakfast buffet was basic, bar staff were friendly, but had no idea how to make basic cocktails even though they were on the drinks menu. ####[['Location was convenient', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' staff were really helpful and friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The room was extremely dark as our window looked out onto a wall and a roof top with broken air conditioner units on', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' house keeping did not replace or restock shower gel , towels or bathroom mats during out 3 night stay', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['They took the dirty towels away without replacing new ones', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['I had to constantly ask house keeping to replace our towels', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['The room was dusty and there were lots of small insects in the room', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' No counter space in the bathroom to leave toiletries', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Limited hanging space / hooks to hang wet towels', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Breakfast buffet was basic', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['bar staff were friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['but had no idea how to make basic cocktails even though they were on the drinks menu', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Very poor for a family room', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

138483,For our wedding anniversary celebration, my family decided to stay at this lovely resort called Memorina. And wow, did it surpass our expectations! Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery, it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape. The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat, bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region. We spent hours wandering around the resort, discovering charming nooks, admiring the vibrant plant life, and even giving fishing a shot. One of the highlights was visiting the sheepfold – an experience that not only captivated us but also filled our kids with wide-eyed wonder. Watching their faces light up as they interacted with the sheep was absolutely heartwarming. During our stay, we were treated to a gentle evening rain, which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand. All in all, our time at Memorina etched a truly special memory in our family's journey. ####[[' We spent hours wandering around the resort , discovering charming nooks , admiring the vibrant plant life , and even giving fishing a shot', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive , always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['it surpass our expectations', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['During our stay , we were treated to a gentle evening rain , which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ["our time at Memorina etched a truly special memory in our family ' s journey", 'Experience', 'Positive']]

She was great, explaining the local dishes and helping me order food. With her I got to try many delicious Vietnamese food. After that we went on a walk and did a little bit of sightseeing. She also gave a little map with everything explained, including some words in Vietnamese in case you need to ask directions to locals!

The ceiling was a bit low and the room was a bit older than the photos, but it was fine. There's no good food around the place and it was about 10 mins by motorbike from Old Quarter.

The staff were super helpful and friendly during my stay. They recommended some cafes with awesome view and try their best to fulfill my request. This homestay serve vegan food for lunch and dinner. I tried their local Vietnamese style began food and it was delicious. The chef has many years of working experience in hospitality line. She worked in 5-stars resorts in South East Asia and Middle East. As it was low season due to covid-19, the owner took extra mile by offering me a personal trip from Sapa to Y Ty when i asked him for tour package.

253,A Friend's Recommendation Unveils the Magic of Zizi Homestay in Sapa I am filled with immense excitement as I recount my extraordinary journey to the captivating landscapes of Sapa, Vietnam. Inspired by a friend's heartfelt recommendation, I embarked on a quest to discover the hidden treasures of this enchanting region. My adventure led me to the remarkable Zizi Homestay, and I can confidently say that it was an experience that exceeded all expectations—a journey that was truly worth every moment. Upon arriving at Zizi Homestay, I was instantly captivated by the beauty of its surroundings. Nestled amidst the awe-inspiring landscapes of Sapa, it stood as a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and culture. The gentle embrace of Zizi's warm hospitality and the sincere smiles of the Hmong people made me feel instantly at ease. It was evident from the very beginning that my friend's recommendation was a precious gift. The allure of Zizi Homestay extended far beyond its idyllic setting. It was a gateway to the vibrant tapestry of Hmong culture. With boundless enthusiasm, Zizi welcomed me into her world, eager to share the rich heritage and traditions of her community. I was invited to immerse myself in the fascinating art of batik dyeing, guided by the skilled hands of the Hmong artisans. It was a mesmerizing experience that allowed me to witness firsthand the intricate craftsmanship and the indomitable spirit woven into every stitch. Throughout my stay, Zizi proved to be an extraordinary hostess, going above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of my journey was filled with wonder and delight. From guiding me on breathtaking treks through the emerald rice terraces to introducing me to the flavors of traditional Hmong cuisine, Zizi's genuine care and passion created an atmosphere of true warmth and hospitality. ####[]

441,Well worth the price! Convenient location right by the airport. Premium looking finishes in the interior of the room and the hotel in general. Clean and fresh sheets everyday care of the excellent housekeeping. Great pool area and good view of the sunset from higher levels. Service and care from the front desk staff is EXCEPTIONAL, in addition to the good level of english they have. They are quick to respond to any concerns and queries guests have. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel as one of the budget-friendly options in the island. They lock the front doors at night but the staff are easily contactable to open the door even at early hours of the morning. Maybe the hotel could switch to a passcode/keycard system for this as not to disturb the staff too much?Food could also be a bit better but this is not too much of a drawback for the value you are getting from your stay. The location is also not the best as there is nothing too noteworthy in the immediate area, but Grab is easily accessible to downtown 10 minutes away.

A broad selection of toiletries was provided (except for body lotion). Instant coffee, electric tea kettle, and a mini bar with an assortment of beer, soft drinks, and water. Very nice hotel! Hotel is new and did not seem ready for guests. There were several minor items that needed attention: Batteries in the safe door were needed, for example. Room phone was not set up for operation, there was no room service menu. These were minor but annoying. In addition, check out took way too long (20 minutes).

818,It is quite a modern hostel with all facilities. In fact it looks like a good hotel. There is plenty of space in the dorms, and in the restaurant area near reception. The beds are large and comfortable. In fact the beds are like a capsule, so once you close the curtain, there is full privacy. The bathrooms are sufficient and well equipped. They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop. I rented motorbike from here. They have really new and good quality bikes. The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house. They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat, cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike. The extra luggage can also be stored for free. They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop. The staff at the reception speaks and understands English. While the facilities are top notch, their maintenance is not upto the mark. People wear shoes in the dorms, there is nobody responsible for the lockers. There are lockers but the key is not available. I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people. They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests. The dorms are air conditioned, but since the beds are capsule type, there is no ventilation inside the cubicle.

139235,We like the design aesthetic of the hotel which gives a very authentic local vibes. The garden view studio has a nice pair of lounge chairs with a small coffee table facing the outside garden. We also loved the indoor koi fish pond which was full of giant koi fishes swimming around. Staff service is excellent and helpful. Location is good as it’s not located by the main road which can be noisy but it’s just right behind the main road and is walking distance to the beach. The breakfast is pretty decent and has everything for a wholesome breakfast. The wooden blinds in the bathroom was difficult to operate. The toiletries provided - shower cream, shampoo & conditioner could be better. The rattan interior also needs some fixing as the cabinet doors with rattan was damaged when we checked in. ####[['We like the design aesthetic of the hotel which gives a very authentic local vibes', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The garden view studio has a nice pair of lounge chairs with a small coffee table facing the outside garden', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['We also loved the indoor koi fish pond which was full of giant koi fishes swimming around', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Staff service is excellent and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Location is good as it ’ s not located by the main road which can be noisy but it ’ s just right behind the main road and is walking distance to the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' The breakfast is pretty decent and has everything for a wholesome breakfast', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The wooden blinds in the bathroom was difficult to operate', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The toiletries provided - shower cream , shampoo & conditioner could be better', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], [' The rattan interior also needs some fixing as the cabinet doors with rattan was damaged when we checked in', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

138544,This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it's very near the Lake, the cute little streets, restaurants, night market, you name it. When you enter the hotel, you notice that the narrow entrance - which is normal for all hotels and houses in Hanoi - opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours, furniture and benches, and the most welcoming staff. Will, the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived, explained everything about the hotel and Hanoi as if he was a tour-guide, and he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits. Will is not the only gem in this hotel, as other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness, which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect. The hotel has a lift, a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby, the rooms have great beds (thank you) and a good lay-out for the space in an inner city hotel. It also has a lovely breakfast place (beautiful decoration) with good choices of food and drinks, and again great staff. However, one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the Skybar and roomservice is the best we had in Hanoi - by far. So we hope they create an inviting restaurant or rooftop eatery that creates a place for the chef to display her/his talents. Other good things to write about are the Spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff, and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place. Vietnam is colourful, and this is reflected in the interior design. We saw tourists stay here, as well as business people and locals, so we felt right at home. The hotel could possibly offer water refill-locations so less plastic is used, but it seems that Vietnam should tackle that problem in more hotels and locations. ####[["This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it ' s very near the Lake", 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours , furniture and benches', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['and the most welcoming staff .

Waking up early to prepare a takeaway breakfast for us at 5am, providing so much information for us, holding our bags for us during our trips away, greeting us like friends every-time we arrived and even decorating our room with a welcome home flyers and petals on our bed for our last night! We felt so at home and treated so well by the wonderful staff here. The location was also amazing, walking distance to the centre of old town without feeling like you were too much in the hustle and bustle. The breakfast was also great, the banana pancakes being a stand out! The rooms were clean and well decorated with great showers. Highly recommend if you are looking for somewhere in Hanoi.

1135,The view from the room My stay was a marathon of mistakes. First the girl at the lobby takes out my debit card from the reader too fast so the transaction fails (but I still get charged) - so I have to pay second time and she requests the bank to give me a refund (WHICH STILL ISNT PROCESSED AFTER 2 WEEKS). Then I want to go to the pool, so I leave my room - but oh the keyroom reader on my door doesn’t work - turns out battery ran out! So I go to the lobby and ask the lobby guy to fix it. He promises to come back in a moment to do so, so I wait for him in my room. Doesnt show up. Had to go ask for it AGAIN the next day for this guy to do his work (of course no one at the reception figured that it would perhaps be a good idea to call me and let me know he wont show up using the room phone next to bed) And then to top it off, its about 3:10 am in the middle of the night and now the hotel room telephone built in next to my bed rings. I pick it up. Nothing. Well, thanks for giving me a call in the middle of the night smart person at the reception So yeah it wasnt a good stay.

1300,The breakfast served at the pantry on the 5th floor every morning was good because I could have a light breakfast. In particular, the soup of rice noodles is very delicious, so I recommend you to try it. The location of the accommodation is near Miding, but it's a little far away. Please note that it's not a distance that you can't walk at all, but it'll be a burden to walk in the middle of the heat. Fortunately, you can visit various attractions in Hanoi using the grap service. The room condition is very very excellent. A comfortable bed and living room(has a comfortable sofa) are provided, and simple cooking is possible with a simple kitchen. I was able to travel comfortably because they cleaned and managed it every day. Also, there was a washing machine on the balcony, and it was so nice to be able to wash wet clothes with sweat. The product description says that there are four bathrooms in three rooms, but in reality, there are three bathrooms in three rooms. The toilet tissue location is so far away that you have to twist your body into an acrobatic way to touch the tissue. There is no space to put shampoo or soap in the shower booth. There's not enough space to put soap in the sink. In addition, it does not provide soap.

994,The staff people at the reception are very very nice, smiley, helpful and at the restaurant some staff people are nice too. The bedroom is confortable, the bed I slept is so well and it's so comfy. They provide what you need for the beauty products or sanitary at the lobby ground floor for you, so you can take into your room. The decoration of the hotel is beautiful and modern but with warm and bright colours. You can't actually open the window in the room (since it's a big one with view on the area) so that's what I didn't appreciate since I like having air coming into my room. Especially one girl, at the restaurant/lounge area don't know how to smile, that's so impolite, they have a face like you're annoying, and giving them some job to do they don't want to do.

524,We ended up staying at the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, so I can only comment on that. Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom. We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool. Breakfast was very good and a sensible price. if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel. Very handy little shop called Moon Milk on the street corner. A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage. The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing. We landed on a (relatively) cold and rainy evening and took the long taxi ride from Da Nang airport. The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance. We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that. There was a notice on the door saying to go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, giving the address. A sketch map would have been useful! It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel. The gentleman on reception took us up to a room, leading in and coming back out very rapidly. Obviously there was some kind of problem, and he wished to be professional about it. He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card. We were ushered to another room, which was clearly an upgrade. Whilst it lacked a couple of things (such as a toilet roll, which appeared the next day), it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom. To the credit of the manager, he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances. ####[['Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast was very good and a sensible price', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['A sketch map would have been useful', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The gentleman on reception took us up to a room , leading in and coming back out very rapidly', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Obviously there was some kind of problem , and he wished to be professional about it', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['We were ushered to another room , which was clearly an upgrade', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Whilst it lacked a couple of thing', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['To the credit of the manager , he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances', 'Service', 'Negative']]

1029,Our stay at Azerai was great. The staff were friendly and super attentive, and the facilities were nice and new. From the moment we were picked up, we were very well taken care of. One minor issue of an old razor being found in our room was made up for with a room upgrade. Food in the restaurant was good, albeit a little pricey but options in Can Tho were easy to access. The staff were great in recommending various places to visit. The highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local’s house while we waited for the rain to pass. Everything was super genuine and authentic - The guide, also a resort employee, grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing! Lastly the hotel transfer from Ho Chi Minh City was excellent - a comfortable limousine van which made the two hour trip each way enjoyable. Would recommend to visit, and stay in the Lake rooms. We started in the Garden Room, but the view from the Lake Room is better. If possible try avoid the weekends and local school holidays as the resort is much quieter. It was overall GREAT value for money, however the experiences/tours and the restaurant were a bit on the pricier side. ####[['Our stay at Azerai was great', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The staff were friendly and super attentive ,', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['the facilities were nice and new', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' From the moment we were picked up , we were very well taken care of', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Food in the restaurant was good , albeit a little pricey but options in Can Tho were easy to access', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The staff were great in recommending various places to visit', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local ’ s house while we waited for the rain to pas', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Everything was super genuine and authentic', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The guide , also a resort employee , grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' made the two hour trip each way enjoyable', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Would recommend to visit , and stay in the Lake rooms', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['We started in the Garden Room , but the view from the Lake Room is better', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['If possible try avoid the weekends and local school holidays as the resort is much quieter', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], [' It was overall GREAT value for money', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['however the experiences / tours and the restaurant were a bit on the pricier side', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['Lastly the hotel transfer from Ho Chi Minh City was excellent - a comfortable limousine van', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['One minor issue of an old razor being found in our room was made up for with a room upgrade', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

139460,Our experience at Zizi homestay in Sapa was a spiritual journey that allowed us to witness the sacred rituals and beliefs of the Hmong community. The lodge, surrounded by towering peaks, provided a breathtaking setting for our trek. The guided trek led us through sacred sites, ancient temples, and shared moments of spiritual reflection. Each step felt like a step towards embracing the sacred wisdom of Hmong culture. The reverent hosts guided us through traditional ceremonies, offering us insight into their spiritual practices. Back at the lodge, we were treated to a sacred ritual, witnessing the deep reverence the Hmong have for their ancestors and nature. As the sun set, we gathered for a contemplative meditation session, enveloped in the profound tranquility of the mountains. While our overall experience was fantastic, some guests noticed occasional water supply disruptions, which added to the rustic charm but might cause minor inconveniences. However, it became an opportunity to appreciate the sacred connection the lodge has with nature and the mountains.

138588,The hotel itself is beautiful. I got a room upgrade which I really appreciated. There were a couple of things missing in the room, but as soon as you call the reception they solve it in a couple of minutes. Staff at the reception was so helpful. They kindly helped me to book a bus ticket, get a taxi and find a place to get banh mi. Thank you very much. Swimming pool area is great and wasn’t crowded during my stay. I wasn’t very impressed with the breakfast quality. Was definitely expecting more from a place with this reputation. The variety was good, but the quality not as good. I tried eggs Benedict from their menu, would not order them again. ####[['The hotel itself is beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I got a room upgrade which I really appreciated', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['There were a couple of things missing in the room , but as soon as you call the reception they solve it in a couple of minutes', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Staff at the reception was so helpful .

139019,I rarely give out 10s, but Marigold hotel deserves it plenty. A fresh, spacious and very comfortable room at an excellent price, that is made up religiously every day. The amenities and appliances in the room are that of a 4 star hotel. The location is spot-on, by the Long Bien bridge and right at the entrance of the old quarters, but in a quiet alleyway. Above all, the staff was always gracious, caring and efficient. Ms Minh Hoang in particular, at the reception, went above and beyond to ensure us a smooth stay. She found an exicellent provider for motorbike rental, and her politeness as well as her kindness never failed. Thank you so much.
