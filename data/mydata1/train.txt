276066,We had a great stay at Bare Han during our four nights in Da Nang. I believe they have four rooms at the property, three of them in one building, and a fourth right next door (the Ground Floor Room). We stayed in the Ground Floor Room, which may have some differences from the other three. We were very happy with the room. It is spacious, the bed is comfortable, and the bedside tables provide a lot of tabletop space to place things - and two electrical outlets above each one for charging devices. The shower has some of the best water pressure we have seen around Southeast Asia, and very stable temperature control. The shower includes a nice rain shower head as well as a handheld. There is a small desk space with two outlets and a decent chair for using a laptop, and there is also a small table with two chairs for dining or drinking coffee. The internet was good enough that I could play a fairly bandwidth-heavy computer game without any glitches during one afternoon. It is easy to get to this place by simply asking your driver to take you to the Da Nang Cathedral. The address provided by the property also worked with our airport taxi, who dropped us at the cathedral. Immediately across the street from the cathedral is an alley with a red banner over it that leads to the building. This alley also has a dessert shop (Mlem Pudding) right across from the Bare Han building, and a coffee shop. The location is excellent, with a convenience store just down the block from the alley entrance, and several Pho and Banh Mi vendors and restaurants just around the corner to the left. There are several coffee shops in the area. We recommend An Le Cafe if you don't mind sitting outdoors with a fan (“Anle Cafe” on Google Maps). If you want air conditioning, Traditional Coffee is around the corner and at the end of the next block. If you need to do laundry while you are here, we took ours to “Co So Giat Uit Hap Minh Trang” at 76 Tran Quoc Toan. This particular room only had two drawbacks, that were not really a problem for us. The first is that the windows at the end of the room look out onto the blank wall of another building, that is less than a meter away. They have put plants in the space, as well as lights, which is a nice solution, but there is very little natural light and you cannot tell how the weather is without opening the front door. The room itself has plenty of artificial light, though. I believe the other three rooms in the main building have windows that look out toward the more spacious alley, but I'm not sure. The only other negative is that the toilet and shower have glass doors. You can draw some curtains around the area outside these two stalls for more privacy, but they are not fully opaque. The toilet and shower stalls themselves also have shades that can be drawn down, and these provide full privacy while in the stalls. ####[['We had a great stay at Bare Han during our four nights in Da Nang', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['We were very happy with the room', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['It is spacious', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the bed is comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the bedside tables provide a lot of tabletop space to place things', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['two electrical outlets above each one for charging devices', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The shower has some of the best water pressure we have seen around Southeast Asia', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['stable temperature control', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The shower includes a nice rain shower head as well as a handheld', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There is a small desk space with two outlets and a decent chair for using a laptop', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The internet was good enough', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I could play a fairly bandwidth-heavy computer game without any glitches during one afternoon', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The location is excellent', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['a convenience store just down the block from the alley entrance, and several Pho and Banh Mi vendors and restaurants just around the corner to the left', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There are several coffee shops in the area', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['the windows at the end of the room look out onto the blank wall of another building, that is less than a meter away', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the toilet and shower have glass doors', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['they are not fully opaque', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The toilet and shower stalls themselves also have shades that can be drawn down, and these provide full privacy while in the stalls', 'Facility', 'Positive']]

273714,The room itself was very spacious - seating area with sofa, bed, dining table, pantry area, bathroom. Basic toiletries and towels were provided. Location was good - lots of food options and cafes around, not too far from the heart of D1 (via Grabcar/Grabbike). Internet was reliable. The room (double room with private bathroom) was EXTREMELY noisy - and this is coming someone who isn't very sensitive to noise/can sleep almost everywhere. I understand it's impossible for it to be completely quiet as the room faces the street and is opposite a school but better windows really need to be installed or, at the very least, thicker velvet curtains that would keep the sound out. On top of that, there was a hole in the upper pane of balcony doors. I didn't mind this so much but I know this is important to some people - the water pressure in the shower is weak. ####[['The room itself was very spacious - seating area with sofa, bed, dining table, pantry area, bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Basic toiletries and towels were provided', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Location was good - lots of food options and cafes around, not too far from the heart of D1', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Internet was reliable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['was EXTREMELY noisy', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['windows really need to be installed or, at the very least, thicker velvet curtains that would keep the sound out', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['there was a hole in the upper pane of balcony doors', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the water pressure in the shower is weak', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' the room faces the street and is opposite a school', 'Amenity', 'Negative']]

273915,We had 2 rooms with street view. The rooms were a bit musty but once the aircon kicked in it wasn't too bad. Beds are hard and water flows out from shower to toilet room. There is a lift to ground floor but you then need to go down another 2 set of stairs to get to the pool. Not good for people in wheelchairs or with mobility issues. I ended up having to go outside and walk down driveway to get to pool. Repeatedly asked to get mini fridge replaced in one room but they had no idea. Kept saying yes and everyday it still didn't work. Gave up after 3 days. The breakfast was quite good. Had a variety of food for buffet and even on the day they did a la carte there was a good choice. Only a 10 min walk to night market. The pool looked nice and the kids enjoyed it. They do supply a towel for swimming. They need more people that can understand English at the front desk. Not sure I would use it again but it was fairly cheap. The ground floor was in construction and nothing down there, just empty rooms. Reception was on 1st floor.

If you are staying in this hotel, I highly recommend booking the combined basket boat tour and cooking lessons with Mr Cu. It was fun for us. We were upgraded to the top floor but the room was not clean e. g. candy wrappers from previous guest, mirror is not clean and the bathroom has molds. We asked to be transfered to another room and they did. The next room was okay but I woke up in the middle of the night smelling molds again. I hope they will make some updates of the building. Second, the breakfast is okay but a bit limited. Lastly, we felt that the ladies at the reception are intrusive. For example, the moment we arrived, we just want a rest as we were tired but she was selling us many many things like tours or tailors and repeat many unnecessary information which was annoying for us. They keep asking questions like who is your taxi driver, where are you going, which store?.. I mean, I understand they get some kind of commision but please we are on our holiday and we decide where to buy stuff. On our last day, the lady tried to convinced us to stay one more night in their hotel and beg to give them 10 review which didnt sit well on us. We feel that it is very intrusive and not professional. ####[['We like the location of this hotel.

270959,Loved the value for money. To have your own room in district one not more than 10 min walk from walking street and the busy bar and restaurant area is super for the price. In a authentic Vietnamese alley and market street locale. Room was a good size. Air conditioning worked well and a nice bathroom. Good work space and table with chairs. View of the city. It's probably a 2 star equivalent in Europe with a 3 or 4 star shower. Would suit a long stay. Like a month to really emmerse in the city or if you had studies to do. Would recommend this hostel/hotel. They take visa and card payments which is great option. Like most things really at this price point. But only thing really was the door to my room number 5 on 4th floor, was a little battered and slight cracks and gaps could be seen. But it did lock! The other doors seemed in better shape.

They dropped me off at the bus station for Mui Ne which was above and beyond. This hostel isn’t the same one that all the reviews rave about because they moved during Covid. Booking’s description says there’s a patio bar and has lots of reviews talk about the roof, and at this location those don’t exist. Also, on booking. com the address is wrong (correct address as of 4/23 is Alley 1/5A, Đường Lê Hồng Phong, Phường 4, Thành phố Đà Lạt, Lâm Đồng, Vietnam) which meant that I showed up to the old hostel address at 4:30 in the morning. Not ideal. We did the classic Mr. Peace tour, which was okay but on the pricier side compared to the rest of vietnam. 35$ for the day, which didn’t include meals, weasel coffee, or gas if you drive yourself. You get to see a lot though which is cool. ####[['very clean', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Staff is very nice and Family dinners were very delicious', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['An helped us check in really early in the morning and kept checking with us during the whole stay, which was lovely', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They dropped me off at the bus station for Mui Ne which was above and beyond', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['We did the classic Mr. Peace tour, which was okay but on the pricier side compared to the rest of vietnam', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['35$ for the day, which didn’t include meals, weasel coffee, or gas if you drive yourself', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], [' You get to see a lot though which is cool', 'Experience', 'Positive']]
273149,The staff were friendly and helpful. The location is good, the beach is 5 minutes on foot away and there's plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants nearby. It's quite cheap. The mattress in the room was horrible. There was a huge dent in the center. At the time the hotel was being renovated, so maybe they would have changed it out, but I think they didn't. The room I stayed in had no window, so it was quite stuffy, but that was expected for the price. I peeped into a renovated higher end room on that floor (the door was open because of the construction), and it looked pretty good. The fridge didn't work (no cooling effect whatsoever) and the little bottles of shower gel and shampoo in the shower seemed to all be missing the little straws inside so you cannot really use the pump on it, which was weird?!The landromat was expensive: 120. 000vnd (or more) for a load of clothes. I literally paid a quarter of that for the same load in Hanoi's Old quarter. Also, I got changed into another room on my last day there, and that was annoying. ####[['The staff were friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["The location is good, the beach is 5 minutes on foot away and there's plenty of cafes, bars and restaurants nearby", 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ["It's quite cheap", 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The mattress in the room was horrible', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The room I stayed in had no window, so it was quite stuffy', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' that was expected for the price', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], [" The fridge didn't work", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the little bottles of shower gel and shampoo in the shower seemed to all be missing the little straws inside so you cannot really use the pump on it', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The landromat was expensive', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['I got changed into another room on my last day there, and that was annoying', 'Service', 'Negative']]

I have stayed at the hotel twice and both times had difficulty flushing minimal amounts of toilet paper, even after 2 or 3 flushes. It's very odd. When hotel is full of families on a holiday weekend, there is a bad shortage of seating at swimming pool. Perhaps more or different kinds of pool furniture can be added. The reception desk wanted to collect a 20 million VND deposit for incidentals. I travel to 5 star properties around Vietnam and find that to be insulting and exorbitant. I refused and was registered on a cash only basis.

270413,Staff was great and super helpful. Breakfast was good, it was nice that you can order different dishes every morning from the menu on top of the buffet. Location was ok, not that close to old quarter but ok walking distance away. Room was cleaned well, we had a complimentary fruit basket in the room. Surfaces in the room were somewhat worn out, and there was some visible water damage in the bathroom, tiles were cracked etc. You could hear all the noises from the hallway. The walls/windows were so thin, that it felt like the windows were open because the traffic noises were so loud, and it was a little hard to sleep. Update // They asked us to do a written review about the hotel upon check out. We wrote same things on that and here in the booking review. Mostly great things about the service and staff, only complaints was the noises and the fact that the room might need some updates/renovations. We waited in the hotel lobby for a car to pick us up to the airport, and the manager came to us apologizing and they gave us a 50% refund from the car service. We thought that was unnessecary, but it felt nice that they reacted to our feedback. I also wrote this booking review waiting in the lobby, usually I wait to get out of the hotel to do that, I should’ve done it now too. The manager had seen my booking review and came back to talk to us, asking us to change the review from 8 to 10. We felt super uncomfortable that he asked us to do so. We just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. For that point we had nothing but great things to say about the staff, but now it left us with a bad taste to our mouths, and this wasn’t a great ending to our 2-week trip to Vietnam, which had been nothing but lovely so far. I had to lower the grade because we didn’t appreciate this kind of doing. ####[['Staff was great and super helpful.

He booked our tours and our bus to Ninh Binh, at a lower price than normal, for us. When we came back from our tour the last day (after we checked out) we could use an empty room to shower and relax. He drove us to the bus station and arrived literally the second the bus was there. He even helped putting the luggage on the bus and made sure we could get on the bus first. This homestay is barely more expensive than a bed in the hostels downtown, but you get above-excellent service. Must-stay in Phong Nha! The bathroom needs a renovation: everything was a bit loose and there was quite a bit of lime scale. However, everything worked. ####[['The room is fine, a bit small but perfectly acceptable', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['The view however is magnificent', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The small balcony is a nice touch', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast is good and plenty', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The owner was extremely helpful and the best part about this homestay', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['He picked us up at the bus station the minute the bus arrived', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['He gave us good recommendations about tours in the area', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Every time we asked a question through Whatsapp, he responded very quickly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['We could use a motorbike from the homestay during our whole stay', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['He booked our tours and our bus to Ninh Binh, at a lower price than normal, for us', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['He drove us to the bus station and arrived literally the second the bus was there', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['He even helped putting the luggage on the bus and made sure we could get on the bus first', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['This homestay is barely more expensive than a bed in the hostels downtown, but you get above-excellent service', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Must-stay in Phong Nha', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['The bathroom needs a renovation: everything was a bit loose and there was quite a bit of lime scale', 'Facility', 'Neutral']]

276901,For Solo travelers an amazing place to stay. The staff is super friendly and always try to help you. You can book great trips there and the Cafe/Bar is also a pretty nice place to relax. I met many nice people there. They also offer a laundry service and free beer :DI liked the location as it isn't really far from the airport and all the interesting spots to visit in Ho Chi minh. I can totally recommend this place! It's really cheap for what you get. I didn't have much space in my shared room. It was pretty tight.

275486,The staff was really nice and always ready to help! The accommodation is on a cute quiet street with a lot of street food vendors nearby. You can get to more touristy area in 15min by walking. I think the location definitely offers “best of both worlds”.I would recommend doing laundry here as well. The room also had a tv that is connected to Wi Fi so you can watch Netflix or You Tube. It definitely has a hotel vibe not hostel so it’s quite at night. Our room had a window that was looking in another room just a one meter away (I think that is the case for all rooms for only 2 person and bigger rooms have windows ). Because of the close proximity of the building the air was not really moving when we opened the windows so the room was quite damp. The bed was also a bit hard. Don’t expect a hostel vibe. There are no community spaces for socialising with fellow travellers. However these are just small inconveniences , all in all we had a lovely stay and even prolonged it for 2 nights! :)) ####[['The staff was really nice and always ready to help', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The accommodation is on a cute quiet street with a lot of street food vendors nearby', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['You can get to more touristy area in 15min by walking', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['I would recommend doing laundry here as well', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The room also had a tv that is connected to Wi Fi so you can watch Netflix or You Tube', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['It definitely has a hotel vibe not hostel so it’s quite at night', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Our room had a window', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Because of the close proximity of the building the air was not really moving when we opened the windows so the room was quite damp', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The bed was also a bit hard', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Don’t expect a hostel vibe', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['There are no community spaces for socialising with fellow travellers', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['we had a lovely stay and even prolonged it for 2 nights', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

Although it is close to Bui Vien street (also known as a walking party street), the guesthouse is located in a little alley, where the music from the bars can't be heard. The highlight of my stay was Ms Vy, she is an excellent host! Ms Vy accompanied me to the local banh mi festival that was happening during my stay. She was great, explaining the local dishes and helping me order food. With her I got to try many delicious Vietnamese food. After that we went on a walk and did a little bit of sightseeing. She also gave a little map with everything explained, including some words in Vietnamese in case you need to ask directions to locals!

271170,This is the first bad review i’ve ever written so far. We booked this hotel because they should offer a buffet breakfast and they should also have a gym. But non of them was provided. There is also almost no breakfast possibilities in the sourroundings exept pho or seafood. We booked a deluxe room in a (apparently) 4 star hotel, but the room we more like a good budget doubleroom. The queensize bed was cozy, but iz was not one double bed but 2 single beds next to each other. The room was only cleaned once during the stay of 4 days.

272251,Honestly nothing... First of all there is no staff, the owner left a non english speaker lady to deal with clients because apparently she's quite busy sleeping. Noboby is there... all the time. You are left alone in the middle of a field and you will feel anxious to leave something valuable in the room because the place is completely deserted. The gate is always open and no staff to watch. You cannot have food but they show wonderful dishes in photos when you book.

275654,We had a phenomenal stay at Jaguar House! The place was very nice, the bungalow clean and the staff very friendly. Great and spacious pool with Jacuzzi but also the beach is only a few meters away. Also there are lots of attractions, restaurants, bars and shops just in walking proximity. The hosts also gave us great recommendations about what to do and also hooked us up with the local tours that made our experience flawless. It might get a bit noisy in the evening as there is a little live music venue across the street but we actually enjoyed the acoustic guitar set they played so that was actually a plus for us and anyway they didn't go past 10pm.

The bathroom was big, too. The staff was friendly and helpful. Apparently, the hotel belongs to the Tourism and Hospitality College of Hue, so the staff are all trainees. Overall a beautiful hotel that needs loads of TLC! The hotel needs a proper clean. I walked in the socks in the room and had to chuck them as they turned black after 5 minutes. The beds didn't have fitted sheets, so would wake up on the mattress (which was also not the cleanest).

274904,The rooms are very well designed! Beds are very comfortable. The rooftop infinity pool is just awesome and you can also get draft beer delivered there. The elevators are just a mess there. They only have four for I think 27 levels and one of them wasn’t working. Sometimes it took ten minutes until an elevator arrived. Breakfast is good but they only serve it from six to nine. And especially from eight to nine it is extremely crowded. The food in the in-room dining menu was only okay. From a five star hotel I expect much better food. What was also really annoying that you can’t charge anything to your room.

274113,- Tanya was a exceptional host, very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay. - Breakfast was super, a good selection of fresh items that are pre-ordered the evening before. The best pineapple juice we've ever had. Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast. - The room was huge, well thought out and as ascetically pleasing. - The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and "cute" at night - Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround. - The beach is a minutes walk away and surprisingly nice and clean. - Good number of affordable bars and restaurants (we went to Mr Hoà's Kitchen and The Tamarinde Tree, Baby Mustard) - Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies, local area. Or to cycle to Hoi An old town, busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly. - Can get a grab from the end of the road in to Hoi An old town for about 75k VND (10 minute journey), we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening. - The hotel is small and therefore the pool is, if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves - It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren't aware. - Bikes could do with some maintenance, oil, tyres, new bell etc - but this seems to be a theme in Vietnam :) ####[['Tanya was a exceptional host, very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast was super, a good selection of fresh items that are pre-ordered the evening before', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["The best pineapple juice we've ever had", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The room was huge, well thought out and as ascetically pleasing', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and "cute" at nigh', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' The beach is a minutes walk away', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['surprisingly nice and clean', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Good number of affordable bars and restaurants', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies, local area', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' to cycle to Hoi An old town, busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The hotel is small and therefore the pool is', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ["It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren't aware", 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['Bikes could do with some maintenance, oil, tyres, new bell', 'Service', 'Neutral']]

Our room was very good, with a huge 8ft bed, everything was very clean. The beach was out of this world, wonderful. The hills, to leave the resort one was required to walk up a very steep hill for approximately 200/300 yards. We only did it once, never again. The temperature was 30°c plus. The resort has golf buggies which stand idle for much of the day, surely they could be used to ferry guests to the top and down again if necessary. The security man could easily be used and it would make his job a bit more fulfilling. Taxis are available and not expensive but it goes against the grain to pay for taxes every time you need to do little shopping. ####[['Breakfast was excellent, catering for eastern and western tastes', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The open sided sunrise room was high up and gave beautiful views of the resort and the beach', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Our room was very good, with a huge 8ft bed, everything was very clean', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The beach was out of this world, wonderful', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The hills, to leave the resort one was required to walk up a very steep hill for approximately 200/300 yards', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The temperature was 30°c plus', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], [' The resort has golf buggies', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' The security man could easily be used and it would make his job a bit more fulfilling', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['Taxis are available and not expensive', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' it goes against the grain to pay for taxes every time you need to do little shopping', 'Experience', 'Negative']]
271158,Bamboo Farmstay is where I enjoyed the most authentic Vietnamese hospitality experience of my entire trip. The owner, Nam, his sister, and the entire family were extremely kind, attentive, and caring throughout our stay. Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh, but I insisted on paying for it, as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me. Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex, a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future. I highly recommend visiting this area now, before the crowds descend. Nam's farmstay is a hidden gem, and I'm glad I chose it over other homestays that were located in a cramped area with a challenging road. This farmstay, on the other hand, is situated on a good road, close to the main thoroughfare that leads to two of Ninh Binh's main attractions: the pagoda and the river tour. The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent, and the Vietnamese cuisine they serve is simply delicious. Although they normally close at 9 PM, they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry. While the rooms are quite basic, they offer air conditioning and hot showers, and for the price, they are an unbeatable deal - under $10 per night! You'll also have the chance to stay in a charming bamboo bungalow, which is a real treat. All in all, I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future. I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience. ####[['The owner, Nam, his sister, and the entire family were extremely kind, attentive, and caring throughout our stay', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh, but I insisted on paying for it, as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex, a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['I highly recommend visiting this area now', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Although they normally close at 9 PM, they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['While the rooms are quite basic, they offer air conditioning and hot showers, and for the price, they are an unbeatable deal - under $10 per night', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], [' I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience', 'Loyalty', 'Positive']]

This was at the last minute on our way to airport. My partner who has a heart condition had to walk in the hot sun to find an atm.

The location is perfect, in the city but quieter when compared to the main road area. We ate at the restaurant several times, the seafood buffet was good, a la carte was really good too. The spa was lovely. We were very happy with our stay at Furama. It was great overall, we were very happy with our stay, difficult to find anything wrong. To note, for a family of 2 adults + 2 children, it would make sense to book an ocean view suite rather than take a garden view room. This is because when they say 2 twin beds, it means 2 single beds in the garden room which aren't useful for 2 adults and 2 kids. So you have to take an extra bed at an added cost. Hence for a similar price, take the ocean view room which come with 2 platform sofa's which can convert to 2 kids beds and a fantastic view!

275343,Cherry the owner was lovely, she let us check in early as we had just gotten off of a bus at 7am. We had a sleep and then paid later on and she even went to the lengths of cooking us some food as we weren’t feeling very well. - the breakfasts were the best we had in Vietnam, they were very cultural and yummy. The garden was beautiful and relaxing to sit in. - you can book busses and tours through Cherry aswell. We had used the laundry service offered at Cherry Homestay, however a few of our items had gone missing (even though we were the only people staying there at this point, so nothing should have been mixed up?) After asking if I could come with her to the drying area, i immediately saw some more of our laundry hanging up at the front. I asked if Cherry knew where the rest was but I sort of just received a shrug and she left.. so I’m now missing underwear and a few tops.. :( - this was extra disappointing as we had had a lovely time all round. ####[['Cherry the owner was lovely, she let us check in early as we had just gotten off of a bus at 7am', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['We had a sleep and then paid later on and she even went to the lengths of cooking us some food as we weren’t feeling very well', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['the breakfasts were the best we had in Vietnam, they were very cultural and yummy', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The garden was beautiful and relaxing to sit in', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['you can book busses and tours through Cherry aswell', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['We had used the laundry service offered at Cherry Homestay', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['this was extra disappointing as we had had a lovely time all round', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['a few of our items had gone missing', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['After asking if I could come with her to the drying area, i immediately saw some more of our laundry hanging up at the front', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['I asked if Cherry knew where the rest was but I sort of just received a shrug and she left', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

275379,Very good location; albeit being placed on a busy street, it was calm enough. The bed was very comfortable, and there was enough storage space in the room. There is a good basement for motorbike parking. Cheap shuttle (taxi) to the airport - half the price of Grab offer. Upon our arrival, the receptionist just gave us the key without any information about the hotel (how to get to our room, what activities it offers etc.). In the room, there were writings on the wall, perhaps made by some kids in the past, the toilet seat was loose, the mirror cabinet was broken. There was a lot of dust behind and under the bed. The water temperature in the shower was always random, no matter what position one puts the handle to. In the mornings (usually after 7. 30 am), there were construction sounds heard from beyond the wall - there was no way to sleep through it. Based on my experience in Asia, 10k VND for a small bottle of water (especially in a nice hotel) is just ridiculous; usually it's free. ####[['Very good location', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['albeit being placed on a busy street, it was calm enough', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ['The bed was very comfortable, and there was enough storage space in the room', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There is a good basement for motorbike parking', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Cheap shuttle (taxi) to the airport - half the price of Grab offer', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['the receptionist just gave us the key without any information about the hotel', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['In the room, there were writings on the wall', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the toilet seat was loose, the mirror cabinet was broken', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['There was a lot of dust behind and under the bed', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The water temperature in the shower was always random', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['there were construction sounds heard from beyond the wall - there was no way to sleep through it', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['10k VND for a small bottle of water (especially in a nice hotel) is just ridiculous', 'Service', 'Negative']]

271192,The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport. The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance. Owner stays just next door so it’s easy to reach out if you have any issues provided that she’s at home. Room is comfy and clean. Aircon is a little weak but it works. Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair. Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin. Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin. Owner gave the pin to the metal gate via message through Booking. com’s app but just note that the metal gate is right in front of the apartment on the 5th floor, not the big gate on ground floor facing the street. Since the apartment is located on the 2nd street away from the main road, it’s not too noisy at night. The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries. There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe. The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift. Luckily there is a cement strip laid over the staircase which probably is meant for bicycles but it works fine to roll my small suitcase up. You’re also supposed to pay your room fee upon arrival in cash - which the fault is mine since I didn’t read carefully before booking. So be prepared to bring extra cash, or exchange money in the many shops at the night market. ####[['The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ['Aircon is a little weak but it works', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Room is comfy and clean', 'Facility', 'Positive']]

The partner bar at the beach is a fantastic place to spend a lazy day and again has great food. Difficult-to-please teenagers were in heaven. We had am amazing time. Really hard to think of anything.

275946,The location of the property was amazing. The room was nice and the bathroom as well. The breakfast had a wide range of options and was delicious. The staff only cared to inform us the pool, rooftop bar, and other facilities such as jacuzzi and sauna were closed due to maintenance after we paid for the room. We specifically chose this hotel for its facilities as the weather in Ho Chi Minh can be very hot. So, they should have informed us before we paid. They did offer another pool at Cochin Sang Hotel, which was 5 min away by foot. However, it was more like a bubble bath instead of a pool, and the inconvenience of having to walk to another hotel wasn’t worth it. Another thing worth mentioning is that we gave them our laundry. When we received it back, our socks were bleached and grew 2x in size. This meant that they were ruined and couldn’t be worn anymore. We did come to an agreement, in which the cost of the laundry was free and the taxi to the airport paid by the hotel, however, it did come with a lot of inconvenience as me and my partner were travelling more after Ho Chi Minh. ####[['The location of the property was amazing', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The room was nice and the bathroom as well', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The breakfast had a wide range of options and was delicious', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The staff only cared to inform us the pool, rooftop bar, and other facilities such as jacuzzi and sauna were closed due to maintenance after we paid for the room', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['We specifically chose this hotel for its facilities', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['they should have informed us before we paid', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['it was more like a bubble bath instead of a pool, and the inconvenience of having to walk to another hotel wasn’t worth it', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['When we received it back, our socks were bleached and grew 2x in size', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['This meant that they were ruined and couldn’t be worn anymore', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['We did come to an agreement, in which the cost of the laundry was free and the taxi to the airport paid by the hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['it did come with a lot of inconvenience as me and my partner were travelling more after Ho Chi Minh', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

There were many problems with the room. Firstly there are no external windows, only a window into the corridor. This was constantly lit through poor curtains meaning the room was never dark. There was no separation between the bar/music and our room, I could make out conversations whilst trying to sleep. The pool plant room was just outside the ‘window’, this was quite noisy. Most annoyingly was the loud hammering that lasted about 5 mins every morning at 7am. You could set your clock by it. We thought this was some in-house maintenance but it woke us every time.

The bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet, there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed, the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area. I'm not sure if it was a residential building as well, but there was a family staying on our floor that had two rooms, and left the door open between them, yelling very loudly in the hallway at all hours.

270780,Location is great. Modest butique hotel in main tourstic street in Hanoi. Good for classic touristic shopping, food etc. It is a walking distance from the most of locations (Imperial Citadel, Garden of Literature etc.).Rooms are nice and ok. Most of the staf are more than kind and tries their best. It is a small but nice hotel. There is a small Only one thing was really bad. I kindly ask Sandy at reception if there is any place where I could change 20-30USD. She said (and that was not true) that it is Sunday so everything is closed. She offered me really bad exchange rate (quite worse then the one I got at Intecontinental a day before) and once more confirmed I can not exchange it outside. After that (lie) i went out and after 1min walk saw that there are many touristic small agencies where you can exchange money with quite better rate. I was really dissappinted because it a small cheating which simply makes all worse than it might be. So don't cheat that way - it is not ok. I came back and said that at reception. I did not get even "I am sorry." Breakfast was also modest but ok.

274450,This is a cozy family home that has everything you need. Don't expect anything too fancy though. As a solo travel who usually stays at hostels, it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel. The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening. The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I've stayed at. Bathroom was shared but was always empty. The private room also locks. Everything I could ask for! Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market. The stairs inside the home are a little challenging. The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small (I had to navigate them going down with my feet sideways). Fortunately, my room was on the first level above ground, but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you. Also, finding the apartment was a little tricky. Finding the address of the building was fine. Take the concrete stairs up a flight and go down the first hall to your right. There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it's easy to miss. I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end, but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn't confirm if I was at the right place. I left but ended up being redirected back to the apartment. The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English. The whole family is lovely, but it can be hard to find the apartment. ####[['This is a cozy family home that has everything you need', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening', 'Service', 'Positive'], [" The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I've stayed at", 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Bathroom was shared but was always empty', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The private room also locks', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Everything I could ask for', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' The stairs inside the home are a little challenging', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' finding the apartment was a little tricky', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['my room was on the first level above ground, but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['The whole family is lovely', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' it can be hard to find the apartment', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [" I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end, but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn't confirm if I was at the right place", 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it's easy to miss", 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

He promises to come back in a moment to do so, so I wait for him in my room. Doesnt show up. Had to go ask for it AGAIN the next day for this guy to do his work (of course no one at the reception figured that it would perhaps be a good idea to call me and let me know he wont show up using the room phone next to bed) And then to top it off, its about 3:10 am in the middle of the night and now the hotel room telephone built in next to my bed rings.

272386,Good location, good happy hours and comfy beds. This hotel claims to be the first 5* in Hanoi and even though the price tag is there, I don’t think the hotel is yet. The hotel itself is beautiful, especially the main lobby area but our room was very underwhelming. We stayed in room 301 which was between some sort of staff room and the staff only elevator so there was a lot of noise from 7am onwards. There was also a lot of maintenance work going on on Monday 10/04 which had us up very early (sounded like drilling). Our toilet and shower cubicles both had mould around the floor tiles too! We used the facilities on the roof top, both the pool and the bar and these weren’t at a 5* standard either. The pool is really small and there are only 8 loungers which are super close together. Despite them being full, no staff offered us the lounge cushions which I found inside near the sauna but they were very quick and pushy about us ordering drinks whilst we were using the facilities. The bar has a good happy hour but it was a good 15/20 minute wait per drink. The drinks themselves were excellent though and they make a top notch Negroni! I think they need to make a couple of tweaks to get this place up to standard and it definitely could be there with some changes but as it currently is, there are more affordable and equally nice hotels around the old town. ####[['This hotel claims to be the first 5* in Hanoi and even though the price tag is there, I don’t think the hotel is yet', 'Branding', 'Neutral'], ['The hotel itself is beautiful, especially the main lobby area', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['but our room was very underwhelming.

275998,Good hotel,lovely rooftop area and small but refreshing pool. The location is perfect with everything at your door. Not a criticism but an observation. The staff strive for excellence and deliver. We are very lucky coming from a wealthy country to be able to afford a hotel in this category and pay the rate it asks,something not so available to most Vietnamese. In their pursuit of excellence i felt the staff were required to show a sense of deference. I felt slightly uncomfortable when they rushed to open the hotel door if they hadnt noticed me coming in or out,i felt slightly uncomfortable being referred to as 'Sir' all the time--I prefer more a more casual,,relaxed service from staff.

274053,New hotel, ok location Quite simply, the hotel lied...about many things. Lie 1) I booked this hotel for my wife's birthday as it has a spa centre, as per the info on their website. There is NO operating spa centre. When I asked about this I was told it was still under construction and that if I wanted to book a spa we can walk around the corner. Lie 2) I'm training for a triathlon so when I saw that the fitness centre is open 24 hours, I thought great! The gym closes at 7pm and is NOT 24 hours. Also, the treadmills don't work. The belt stalls with each step so you can't even walk let alone run. And there are no sanitizing wipes, towels, bins or even access to water. Lie 3) The sunset bar looked great on their website, especially with the snacks and "signature cocktails" noted. There are NO cocktails and no snacks. And what the heck is the point of a pool and bar that closes at 7pm? I kept being told, not enough staff. Lie 4) The restaurant '12 Kitchen' is listed on their website as serving a buffet breakfast and dinner. There is NO dinner served and the breakfast closes at 9:30am. Lie 5) The hotel is listed on booking. com as 5 stars?! I'm not sure on which planet they got this rating but it is a 3 star at best. Definitely not an international standard 5 star. There is also, NO room service and nothing in the mini bar in the rooms. The rooms are ok, but...Upon arrival, the top shelves in the wardrobes were very dusty and we had to wipe them down before using them. The rooms were relatively clean but definitely not to a high standard. Housekeeping staff didn't even wash the glasses on a number of occasions. There is only a kettle with a couple of sachets of coffee issued. The toilets....oh the toilets...if you plan on using anything more than 3 individual squares of toilet paper, be prepared for a blocked toilet. Terrible toilets! ####[[' the hotel lied', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['New hotel', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['ok location', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Quite simply', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['When I asked about this I was told it was still under construction and that if I wanted to book a spa we can walk around the corner', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' There is NO operating spa centre', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['The gym closes at 7pm and is NOT 24 hours', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["the treadmills don't work", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["The belt stalls with each step so you can't even walk let alone run", 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' there are no sanitizing wipes, towels, bins or even access to water', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['And what the heck is the point of a pool and bar that closes at 7pm', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['I kept being told, not enough staff', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['There are NO cocktails and no snacks', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['There is NO dinner served and the breakfast closes at 9:30am', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["I'm not sure on which planet they got this rating but it is a 3 star at best.", 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['Definitely not an international standard 5 star', 'Branding', 'Negative'], [' NO room service and nothing in the mini bar in the rooms', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the top shelves in the wardrobes were very dusty and we had to wipe them down before using them', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' The rooms were relatively clean but definitely not to a high standard', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], [" Housekeeping staff didn't even wash the glasses on a number of occasions", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['There is only a kettle with a couple of sachets of coffee issued', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['if you plan on using anything more than 3 individual squares of toilet paper, be prepared for a blocked toilet', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Terrible toilets', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

270850,The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture. There were ample electrical socketss. The bathroom and plumbing was quite good. The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy. There was plenty of parking near the gate. There was easy access to a lovely clean beach, direct from the resort. There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures. it was surrounded by trees giving ample shade to the loungers. The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view. There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure, Napoli being the best. We have used this one many times in the past. There are some small local shops ( kiosks) for basic needs. The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer. Not much! Like a lot of the resorts here, they suffer from a lack of customers during covid so have an air of being a bit run-down. However the faults were minor and did not detract from our stay. The restaurant only had a partial service due to lack of customers. There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning, when the resort filled up for the weekend. At other times there was a limited menu. There wasn't anywhere to hang wet clothes after, say, a swim and nothing to sit on outside. ####[['The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There were ample electrical socketss', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The bathroom and plumbing was quite good', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There was plenty of parking near the gate', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There was easy access to a lovely clean beach, direct from the resort', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure, Napoli being the best', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There are some small local shops ( kiosks) for basic needs', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning, when the resort filled up for the weekend', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['At other times there was a limited menu', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["There wasn't anywhere to hang wet clothes after, say, a swim and nothing to sit on outside", 'Facility', 'Negative']]

273407,Well worth the price! Convenient location right by the airport. Premium looking finishes in the interior of the room and the hotel in general. Clean and fresh sheets everyday care of the excellent housekeeping. Great pool area and good view of the sunset from higher levels. Service and care from the front desk staff is EXCEPTIONAL, in addition to the good level of english they have. They are quick to respond to any concerns and queries guests have. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel as one of the budget-friendly options in the island. They lock the front doors at night but the staff are easily contactable to open the door even at early hours of the morning. Maybe the hotel could switch to a passcode/keycard system for this as not to disturb the staff too much?Food could also be a bit better but this is not too much of a drawback for the value you are getting from your stay. The location is also not the best as there is nothing too noteworthy in the immediate area, but Grab is easily accessible to downtown 10 minutes away. However the proximity to the island’s airport more than makes up for this in convenience. ####[['Well worth the price', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Convenient location right by the airport', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Clean and fresh sheets everyday care of the excellent housekeeping', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Great pool area and good view of the sunset from higher levels', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Service and care from the front desk staff is EXCEPTIONAL, in addition to the good level of english they have', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They are quick to respond to any concerns and queries guests have', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel as one of the budget-friendly options in the island', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], [' They lock the front doors at night but the staff are easily contactable to open the door even at early hours of the morning', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Maybe the hotel could switch to a passcode/keycard system for this as not to disturb the staff too much', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ['Food could also be a bit better but this is not too much of a drawback for the value you are getting from your stay', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['The location is also not the best as there is nothing too noteworthy in the immediate area, but Grab is easily accessible to downtown 10 minutes away', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ['However the proximity to the island’s airport more than makes up for this in convenience', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ['Premium looking finishes in the interior of the room and the hotel in general', 'Facility', 'Positive']]

271028,The room was spacious and had very wide windows, it was so pleasant to look at the view. The bathroom was also clean and spacious. It has lots of hangers which was very useful for our winter jackets. They also had Netflix on the TV right in front of the bed, which made this place felt more homey. The elevator was small but worked just fine. I've read some reviews that you need to go up through small stairs, but that happened if your property is at 11th floor above. Ours was in 10th so it was fine. The host was very communicative and supportive during our stay. p. s. They also had motorbike rent, but manual only. The bed was a bit thinner that usual bed, so it was not as comfy as your common hotel bed, but we slept just fine. The blanket was very comfortable though so it helped. The ceiling was a bit low and the room was a bit older than the photos, but it was fine. There's no good food around the place and it was about 10 mins by motorbike from Old Quarter. So, you have to rent motorbike if you wanna go to the nearest popular spots.

271016,The cruise was efficient with nearly everything run on time. The food was of a good standard - with all the meals provided there is very little to worry about. You won’t go hungry either - plenty on offer at all times. The staff were friendly and happy to help throughout our stay. This is true of the guide we had on our second day (of three). We were the only guests to stay on for 2 nights (although note there is always a combination of single and 2 night guests) so our second day was just us - perfect! We had arranged transfers with La Regina and both arrived on time and took us where we needed to go. The room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning (very necessary for Westerners visiting Vietnam in July!), lovely bed and private balcony. All the trips had what we needed to participate too. This is not a romantic or quiet cruise; if you want that, I’d look somewhere else. The boat was full when we went and most of the other guests were quiet loud Vietnamese on holiday (it may differ at other times of the year).

I wouldn't be upset if it didn't claimed as 'beachfront' and 'sea view'.Secondly, the soundproofing system is very poor. I can hear everything from the next room and the hall's conversations. Thirdly, the hotel claimed itself as 4-star service but the service is quite more like 3-star. Shampoo and shower gel are outdated. And the hotel also claimed as beachfront but it wasn't. More like 500m from the beach. You can see its location on Google Maps. And the lacking of some important stuffs here, for example it doesn't have "Do not disturb" sign outside the room door.

Her smile brightens up a room and she went out of her way to make sure I always felt comfortable and taken care of whether it be a hot coffee, arranging a tour, or just being a kind human being and sharing a lovely conversation. She is an incredibly sweet hard worker and I would come visit again to see her again. The pool was also fantastic, the breakfast tasty, the chair hammocks very comfortable. The twin bunk room was great because I ended up befriending the other guest and we got along great. The bed was comfy and entire stay was WELL worth the money and very clean and comfortable. After a large rainstorm we did see an insect scurry in, but it was quickly and easily handled.

273485,I really liked my stay at Lam Vien Homestay as it was quaint and really comfortable. I adored getting the chance to speak with owner and learn a little more about his and Hue's history. Plus, I arrived so early and they were more accomidating me as I rented a bike and joined one of the other travellers to journey together. My room was ideal, it was on the first floor and had easy access to the bathroom and privacy if wanted. Breakfast and other things were available though I didn't partake as IO have my own dietary means and wanted to see the city which is so full of history and excitement. I finally arrived late in the evening after consuming as much of the wonder that is Hue. I came back to what was supreme quiet and excellent accommodation as I prepared myself some food and go the comfort and quiet of a evening left to my own devices. Being close to both the north and south sides of Hue, I went off to explore as I would leave reasonably early the next morning and was delighted to be so well placed. I really recommend this incredible homestay and encourage you to stay as long as you can because there is so much that makes Hue ideal to travel and experience.

270085,This was our best accomodation in Vietnam. There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses. There are small pools with fish and water flowers, it is like in a fairy-tale. I really recommend the place. Our bathroom was in the back of the house, outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle. Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also. We arrived in february and the weather was perfect. Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area. This is perfect for nature lovers. The room itself was clean and spacious. Clean towels and linen. The young ladies at the reception are welkoming and very helpful with everything you need. They organised transportation, help with motorcicle or motorbike rental, offer info and help with everything. They are very kind. They organised us the boat tour to floating market and arranged us the transportation to their places and then to the airport in Can Tho based on our group needs. Excellent comunication with them. The place is in the rural area near Can Tho so it is interesting to explore the villages by bicicle and see how people live, make an idea of how the life in around water canals. There is a local-style minimarket at walking distance from the accomodation. If you dont ride bicicle or motorbike the area might look a bit remote. We found no other place to eat at walking distance but we reached a small town at 6 km of bicicle ride with the help of google maps where you can find everything. We bought some exotic interesting fruits there in the fruit market and brought them at the accomodation and enjoyed them in the eating area. The boat tour on the canals and at the floating market revealed a lot of pollution. Plastic waste floating everywhere. It is very sad to see that. Otherwise it is interesting to see the trade at the floating market. ####[['This was our best accomodation in Vietnam', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['There are small pools with fish and water flowers, it is like in a fairy-tale', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I really recommend the place', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['Our bathroom was in the back of the house, outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area.

276550,Its been an outstanding experience indeed one of a kind. It's been 2 years that I am planning on visiting a farm in my next visit to Vietnam, I really wanted to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of the Saigon, and here I am in a magical place, surrounded by beautiful rice fields. The farm is simple and yet very special, one can tell that it was built with love and respect to nature but also for the best traveler experience. If that's not enough, the host was super welcoming, it felt safe, warm, and yet very much private when I wanted to have my space. The room is made of bamboo and natural materials and was spacious and functional. About 10 drive from the farm there is a national park on the Mekong River, the host gave me a ride there and arranged 90 minutes boat ride, this site was also great, nice river and lots of Birds and some Buffalo on the river bank, seeing the sunset on the background of the vast land of the Mekong was beautiful. I am the kind of person that wants to know what he eats, and during this visit I was amazed by the creativity of the Vietnamese cuisine, the host invited me to choose herbs and flowers from the farm’s garden and then cooked delicious local dishes with them accompanied by beef, chicken, and seafood, it was really cool experience that made the lunch and dinner a rewarding experience, I guess there is something about eating what you picked up 2 ago… In terms of accessibility, the host was accommodating as well, guide me where to buy the bus tickets from Ho Chi Minh City, picked me up with his motorcycle from the local bus station, and took me over to the farm which was around 5 minutes drive. If you are curious about the authentic countryside this is the right place if you are well-traveled, and I am, then I am quite certain that you’re after some new memorable experiences. Look no further :) I will be back again, no doubt about that. The mattress, it's not a huge issue but I would recommend having it a bit more thicker. ####[['Its been an outstanding experience indeed one of a kind', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['I am in a magical place, surrounded by beautiful rice fields', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['the host was super welcoming', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['it felt safe, warm, and yet very much private when I wanted to have my space', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The room is made of bamboo and natural materials and was spacious and functional', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['this site was also great, nice river', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['seeing the sunset on the background of the vast land of the Mekong was beautiful', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['the host invited me to choose herbs and flowers from the farm’s garden and then cooked delicious local dishes with them accompanied by beef, chicken, and seafood, it was really cool experience that made the lunch and dinner a rewarding experience', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['In terms of accessibility, the host was accommodating as well, guide me where to buy the bus tickets from Ho Chi Minh City', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['picked me up with his motorcycle from the local bus station', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['took me over to the farm which was around 5 minutes drive', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['If you are curious about the authentic countryside this is the right place if you are well-traveled', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['I will be back again, no doubt about that', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ["The mattress, it's not a huge issue but I would recommend having it a bit more thicker", 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['the host gave me a ride there and arranged 90 minutes boat ride', 'Service', 'Positive']]

274088,The location in the Old Quarter was fantastic and close to everything. The street at the front of the hotel is closed at the weekend, so you may struggle to be dropped outside. This really isn't a problem! All staff were fantastic. There are so many trips and variations on offer and so it was difficult to know what was best for the budget. We listened to Mai's advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted. Everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back. For trips to Sapa, I would recommend the individual cabin on the bus as this was a godsend after such a long walk, try to get the cabin near the front as the ride is smoother and take mosquito spray. Travelling with children, Mai made this much more relaxed! We would recommend the Met restaurant close to the hotel. ####[['The location in the Old Quarter was fantastic and close to everything', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The street at the front of the hotel is closed at the weekend, so you may struggle to be dropped outside', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['All staff were fantastic', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["We listened to Mai's advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted", 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back', 'Service', 'Positive']]

They should have the kids indoor play area where kids can spend their time while staying in resorts. This is one of the biggest drawback in this property 3.

The early morning water market trip on Taun's boat was followed up with a tour of the incredible land market. The Mekong is truly a paradise of exotic fruit, vegetables and fish and the land market shows these off. The guests select the ingredients for the evening meal which is prepared by Tuan's family. An absolute feast!Best of all is Tuan's hospitality. He makes sure that all is organized for a perfect stay including transportation to and from the airport/bus station, boat trip, local tour and delicious meals (3 a day for a nominal cost). He does this with warmth and humor. It was also a treat to socialize with the other guests. We had a fabulous time at Boutique Lodge with wonderful memories to treasure.

270321,I liked everything! The location is nice along a relatively quiet street and away from Back Beach noise. There are many restaurants on the street and easy to find food. Personnel is so nice and attentive, thank you for the young receptionist lady for many great conversations. The suite was beautiful and spacious, even has a kitchen. It was nice to have breakfast in the room. You can choose to have brekkie by the pool, in the lobby area or in your room. They even made sure to offer us glutenfree breakfast. Pool is quite small but in a nice area with sauna and steamroom which you can turn on yourself. Shower / toilet have been built against a huge rock, which makes the area quite unique. The spa upstairs is great, the massage therapists are very good, and one spa treatment is included in the room price. With the free shuttle bus you can go anywhere in the town. Motorbike can be parked in the parking hall. Whoever built the Wind hotels concept knows a lot about excellent customer service and customer retention. We definitely want to go back and can highly recommend this hotel to everyone!

They are very friendly (and they arranged transport for us + it was easy to rent a scooter) but it's hard to ask about extra information on other activities like trekkings and such. ####[['The most beautiful room we had in Sri Lanka', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' very spacious, cosy, nice bathroom and all very clean', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The view tops it off', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Loved our stay here and we would have loved staying an extra night', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The staff does not speak English', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['They are very friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["but it's hard to ask about extra information on other activities like trekkings and such", 'Service', 'Negative']]
274511,The room was comfortable and clean, and the pool was very nice (apart from the rubbish at the bottom). It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi’s are available to get into town. The cleaning staff were very friendly. The staff weren’t helpful - there is a clear lack of management. The pool bar wait times are ridiculous, 1. 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water, 1. 5 for food as well. On our first 2 days the wait wasn’t as bad but there was only one person, the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long. The food and drink is also very overpriced (western prices) and very average. The laundry service is ridiculously expensive, we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear! There is no local advice available from the staff. We weren’t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren’t offered the welcome drink they advertise. Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment. The breakfast is constantly running out, and even if all the food and drink is available, there are no cups or plates to use! The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover, there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it. Overall, this is a 3 star experience, but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it’s a good option. ####[['The room was comfortable and clean, and the pool was very nice ', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi’s are available to get into town', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The cleaning staff were very friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The staff weren’t helpful - there is a clear lack of management', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The pool bar wait times are ridiculous', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['1. 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water, 1. 5 for food as well', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['On our first 2 days the wait wasn’t as bad but there was only one person, the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long', 'Service', 'Negative'], [' The laundry service is ridiculously expensive, we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The food and drink is also very overpriced', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['and very average', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['There is no local advice available from the staff', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['We weren’t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren’t offered the welcome drink they advertise', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The breakfast is constantly running out, and even if all the food and drink is available, there are no cups or plates to use', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover, there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['this is a 3 star experience, but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it’s a good option', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

270803,Exceptional location! Surrounded by mountains and with a lake in front, away from the chaos of city, serene and peaceful. The property is nestled within a well maintained garden, has swings and a lounging/dining area. the room was spacious, clean with decently done decor, a large bathroom and deck. I loved the view from the room- of the sun coming up from behind the mountain and shining on the lake, filling the room with sunlight. Hai - the host is quite a barista and brews very good Italian coffee. The family dog Gung - is very friendly and welcoming. The hosts were very welcoming and generous - even offering to help with our laundry. I would without a doubt recommend this place to stay. Note: The location is ~ 2 kms from city centre and dining options. So you will need a motorbike/cycle to get there. The property will be able to help with those options.

There was a good selection of western and local Vietnamese dishes available for breakfast like the Bahn My that was made upon request, as well as rice paper rolls, dumplings, local rice flour based cakes and coconut drink The bedroom only had one thick pillow available. I find this to be a common problem in many hotels and I always recommend to make a thick and a thin pillow available.

One minor issue of an old razor being found in our room was made up for with a room upgrade. Food in the restaurant was good, albeit a little pricey but options in Can Tho were easy to access. The staff were great in recommending various places to visit. The highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local’s house while we waited for the rain to pass. Everything was super genuine and authentic - The guide, also a resort employee, grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing! Lastly the hotel transfer from Ho Chi Minh City was excellent - a comfortable limousine van which made the two hour trip each way enjoyable. Would recommend to visit, and stay in the Lake rooms. We started in the Garden Room, but the view from the Lake Room is better. If possible try avoid the weekends and local school holidays as the resort is much quieter.

The design of the hotel is super nice, with a very warm and crafty feeling! The views are absolutely gorgeous. The rooms are big and comfortable. I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics. The room was clean, bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white. The maintenance of the hotel is not the best, which is a real pity, because it was designed so nicely. When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage. The hot water is very inconsistent when showering, sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself! Some staff is nice, others not so much. I think the language barrier is the biggest problem because almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude, which I don't think it's their intention.

274241,The breakfast served at the pantry on the 5th floor every morning was good because I could have a light breakfast. In particular, the soup of rice noodles is very delicious, so I recommend you to try it. The location of the accommodation is near Miding, but it's a little far away. Please note that it's not a distance that you can't walk at all, but it'll be a burden to walk in the middle of the heat. Fortunately, you can visit various attractions in Hanoi using the grap service. The room condition is very very excellent. A comfortable bed and living room(has a comfortable sofa) are provided, and simple cooking is possible with a simple kitchen. I was able to travel comfortably because they cleaned and managed it every day. Also, there was a washing machine on the balcony, and it was so nice to be able to wash wet clothes with sweat. The product description says that there are four bathrooms in three rooms, but in reality, there are three bathrooms in three rooms. The toilet tissue location is so far away that you have to twist your body into an acrobatic way to touch the tissue. There is no space to put shampoo or soap in the shower booth. There's not enough space to put soap in the sink. In addition, it does not provide soap.

So nice to plug into Netflix for a few minutes while you're waiting for the wife and daughter to finish up in the bathroom! :-). The breakfast was very good for the price and having free bikes to pedal around on was fun. My daughter fell in love with the owner's dogs - I just wanted to eat them (kidding!). Hue is an incredible city that we should have spent more than 36 hours in...don't make the mistake we made - make the Le Robinet a few days stay!

Very courteous and polite staff each time we reached out to them to gather some information. Staff were really the standout!! Breakfast was very decent. Eggs could be ordered, the menu changes each day with some items like bread, croissant, danish were the same throughout. When our daughter was sick, they also allowed to carry the breakfast to the room. The restaurant staff packed us breakfast for our daughter. Hotel is located at a place where it is walking distance, most of the old quarter areas and some beyond could be covered by walking. It's quite chaotic to walk in the narrow streets where traffic is both ways but it was very much fun. Coming from India, it was not very different to the experience in India. We booked the tour guide via the hotel and it was very good. The hotel staff advised us clearly about the charges, gave recommendations to what sort of tour we must go for based on the time we had. Overall it was a very satisfying holiday. One of the restaurant staff didn't bother to check if a salad was pure vegetarian before advising us. The salad contained ham, and we were pure vegetarians.

270574,The pool was a god send as we had moved from another hotel in the city as it did not have a pool. Also the close proximity to the airport and free shuttle service for our departure was excellent. The pool area had no staff in attendance through out the day and I had to go down to the lobby to ask for towels to be sent up. Also there was no option to order meals/drinks at lunch time at the pool; as the staff did not start until 4pm. Again I went down to the restaurant in the lobby to ask about getting a meal & drinks sent up to the pool. I was told the only way we could do this was to order room service and take it up to the pool. So we had to return to our room, order our meal then return to the pool. In that time our towels had been removed so had to go get more towels. All this inconvenience could have been fix with either one staff member in attendance at the pool during the day or a telephone at the pool bar with instructions to call & order meals/drinks over the phone.

273093,The location next to night market is great. The rooms are clean and big However we had issues with the laundry. Half of our laundry became yellow tainted with red/dark stains. When we addressed it, the host didn't take responsibility and blamed the outsourced laundry worker. That lead to lot of discussion with that person (about sunscreen making the yellow stains, but there were more on the clothes after than before it). In the end, we still had to pay for everything and half our clothes are ruined. Our critique is that the host wasn't helpful at all in this situation. ####[['The location next to night market is great', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The rooms are clean and big', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['However we had issues with the laundry', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Half of our laundry became yellow tainted with red/dark stains', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["When we addressed it, the host didn't take responsibility and blamed the outsourced laundry worker", 'Service', 'Negative'], [' In the end, we still had to pay for everything and half our clothes are ruined', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["Our critique is that the host wasn't helpful at all in this situation", 'Service', 'Negative']]

Hot water required 5 mins of running the shower and there was no kettle as stated online. We also had two double beds and told not to use the second, wasn’t the best service I’ve had. Also we were locked out of the hotel as we turned up around 20 past mid night and had to ring the reception to be allowed in, we were not told in advance that they locked up early. also the curtains are thin and so let in a lot of light and you’ll be woken at 6am. ####[['Beds are pretty comfy', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the bathroom was nice', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Hot water required 5 mins of running the shower', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['there was no kettle as stated online', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Also we were locked out of the hotel as we turned up around 20 past mid night', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['We also had two double beds and told not to use the second', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['we were not told in advance that they locked up early', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['the curtains are thin', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['let in a lot of light and you’ll be woken at 6am', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['later the host knocked on our room and said we would be changed 122K as a surcharge for early checkin', 'Service', 'Negative']]

270385,The pool was nice. The location (close to the night market) was also good. I would really not recommend this hotel. We are by no means picky people and have travelled extensively, but this is one of the worst hotels we have ever encountered in terms of price/quality. The room was not cleaned before our arrival (two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it, thus also no clean towels. The place did not only have cockroaches upon arrival, but we kept encountering them. Although we know this might just be the climate, we did not encounter them anywhere else during 3 weeks in Vietnam. The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up, which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm. The water pressure was almost non existent. The airconditioning did not work most of the time. Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible. The staff did not speak a word of English. We had to communicate via Google translate. Overall, this place calls itself a resort, but in comparison with some of the significantly lower priced homestays or other hotels we had throughout three weeks in Vietnam, we would barely call this place a hotel and definitely not a resort. The sun was not present during our 3 days in Phu Quoc, but the 'cosy' part of 'suncosy' was even more absent than the sun. ####[['The pool was nice', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' The location (close to the night market) was also good', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['I would really not recommend this hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['The room was not cleaned before our arrival (two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it, thus also no clean towels', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up, which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' The water pressure was almost non existent.', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The airconditioning did not work most of the time', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The staff did not speak a word of English.

You'll have to paddle or walk southwards, to experience this beautiful longbeachfeel. There is no beach connected to the hotel anymore, despite the pictures. The way to get there is an off-road adventure as local authorities stopped the onsite hotels to get a proper tarmacroad. In rainy season almost unreachable for a usual cab. (Although for us it was great fun with two scooters and five persons.) The food was ok, we rather went elsewhere around, which is quiet a ride. The immense infrastructure projects all around the island will hopefully stop, before there is only overtourism existing.

272606,Our stay at Hanoi Media Hotel and Spa made our trip to Hanoi perfect. The location of the hotel in the Old Quarter is fantastic if you want to be near Hoan Kiem Lake. We were literally 2 minutes walk from the Huc Bridge. We made full use of the amazing location and spent many hours happily exploring the Old Quarter. The team at Hanoi Media did an amazing job looking after us. We arrived in the city via train in the early hours of the morning and went directly to the hotel. I had let them know about our early arrival and they had said if they couldn't accommodate an early check in for us, they would keep our luggage for us until our rooms were ready. As soon as we arrived they prepared a free room for us, at a minimal charge, which we could use for the next 6 hours to freshen up and rest while we waited for our booked rooms to be vacated and cleaned for us. In addition, when checking out, they made one of our rooms available for a late check out, so we could pack and leave the hotel as late as possible. This willingness to ensure our comfort and convenience was maintained throughout our stay and was hugely appreciated by us. They also stored and kept our luggage for us when we checked out to spend 2 nights at Ha Long Bay. Our rooms were great. We booked the Junior Suite with Terrace, and when returning from Ha Long Bay, stayed in the Junior Suite with Balcony. Both rooms were lovely. The Junior Suite with Terrace is an extremely large room with lovely space to move around, and we loved the Junior Suite with Balcony for its fantastic views over the city where we could sit and admire the city lights and sounds. Our second room was the Superior Double Room which served perfectly for our teenage daughters. This was a quiet, safe space where they could sleep in and relax when taking some time off from exploring the city. We enjoyed the Lux Skybar, and the kind doormen at the entrance to the hotel.

Luckily for us, we had time. The location is great and we used this hotel as a base as we did 1-3 day trips around Hanoi. They were great with communication and super accommodating. Highly recommend as a good accomodation for the cost. Hotel construction started at 7:30-11am and we weren't warnded/informed. They were very apologetic about it and we are totally understanding as they have to do it at some point. It would just be considerate to let guests know beforehand (and I have given this same feedback on their checkout form).Still, the room is nice and I would come back to stay here! Thank you to the amazing staff! ####[['Staff were friendly, helpful, polite', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Good advice would be to not book too early and check the weather...better to go sooner while the weather is tame than to be pushed for time and have to cancel some things', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The location is great and we used this hotel as a base as we did 1-3 day trips around Hanoi', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['They were great with communication and super accommodating', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Highly recommend as a good accomodation for the cost', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ["Hotel construction started at 7:30-11am and we weren't warnded/informed", 'Service', 'Negative'], ['They were very apologetic about it and we are totally understanding as they have to do it at some point', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['the room is nice ', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' I would come back to stay here', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['Thank you to the amazing staff', 'Service', 'Positive']]
270076,The accomodation was different from the one shown in the website. They made us stay in a different building which had a tiny room and few amenities. ( We are sharing pictures). The landlord couldn't understand English and overcharged us. The stay is inside a very narrow lane and taxis couldn't reach there. Tip- kindly confirm your stay before you trust the landlord. We checked in late night hence were too tired to object to someone who was old and couldn't understand us. ####[['The accomodation was different from the one shown in the website', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['They made us stay in a different building which had a tiny room and few amenities', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ["The landlord couldn't understand English and overcharged us", 'Service', 'Negative'], ["The stay is inside a very narrow lane and taxis couldn't reach there", 'Amenity', 'Negative']]

The wife/owner of the place sat down and talked to us for 2+ hours when we showed up, and it was such amazing conversation. She told us all about her and her husbands (who was also amazing but spoke little English) struggle to start a hostel in their city. She spoke almost better English than me and I'm American born and raised. Me and my buddy sincerely and thoroughly loved the stay and talking with her and would love to visit again. The husband also changed my front brake pads on my xr150 which was a pain in the a$$ to find, so it was amazing. Please please support these amazing people, I truly hope you do.

Very happily surprised by the equipment quality. The swimming pool is the most relaxing and beautiful place you can imagine. Really made the difference after hot days. Free bicycle,, fresh fruits at breakfast everyday, drinks when you need , impeccable service. Location was exactly what we wanted, close to a local traditional food market/ neighborhood and to paddy fields but also 10mn drive from the hot town. But the best part was Binh, his wife and the whole family. They are truly wonderful hosts, their sense of welcoming is amazing, they are at the same time helpful, discrete, warm , fun and always present when needed. They really welcomed us like family and in a very genuine& sincere way that really made the difference. They have good tips for visiting Hoi An but don't pressure anything which differs from the mood in the center. They truly love what they do, and share this with the guests.

275682,The room was small, but the beds are very comfortable and there was a very nice hot shower. The breakfast was a breakfeast: the amount of food was more than we normally eat in a whole day! The recommendations from the host. The lady at the front is a nosy and pushy to sell you services. Everytime you walk in or out of the hotel she wants to know what you are up to, where you went and gives you 'advise' if you want it or not. When you get back, she checks if you followed her advice ....Her recommendations are not always the best options in town! (We know commissions are in for the hotel, but it was to obvious and pushing)As an example: when we went to the fabric market, and first wanted to look around (we already did our homework) Within 1 minute a lady from the 'recommended' tailor started following us around, and telling us she knew we where staying in Rock Mouse Villa and making it impossible to talk to any other tailor. We decided to have one item made as a test for the experience (not good: pushing to sell and don't give a damn how the finished garment looks on you). As soon as we got back to the hotel, the hotel lady double checked with us if we had indeed only ordered one item (she already knew) at her recommended shop (commission). Don't get me wrong they do this with a friendly smile and the hotel is perfectly fine. But do your homework and make sure you make your own choices that you are happy with. ####[['The room was small', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the beds are very comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['there was a very nice hot shower', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The breakfast was a breakfeast: the amount of food was more than we normally eat in a whole day', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The recommendations from the host', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The lady at the front is a nosy and pushy to sell you services', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["Everytime you walk in or out of the hotel she wants to know what you are up to, where you went and gives you 'advise' if you want it or not", 'Service', 'Negative'], ['When you get back, she checks if you followed her advice', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Her recommendations are not always the best options in town', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the hotel is perfectly fine', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['But do your homework and make sure you make your own choices that you are happy with', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

269977,absolutely gorgeous, even better in real life - felt like a boutique-y four seasons. the bar on the top floor was beautiful and all of the food at the restaurant fantastic. whoever designed or built the hotel is clearly a world traveler with impeccable taste. gym was really nice too (did not take advantage of the spa) service was great except at the pool - constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the (quite large) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don’t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down. It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting, you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes. Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment, you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot (or didn’t understand because of language barrier?). Then by then the food is cold. Frequently saw 2-3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention. Also, the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours (this was a Monday afternoon) stirring up lots of insects. Why isn’t this done early morning or evening when there are less people trying to enjoy the pool? If it weren’t for the pool experience being unpleasant, I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation. Because of this, I don’t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn’t enjoyable to sit by the pool. But we still would come back for the rooms, gym and food. ####[['absolutely gorgeous, even better in real life', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' all of the food at the restaurant fantastic', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['the bar on the top floor was beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['felt like a boutique-y four seasons', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['gym was really nice too', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['service was great except at the pool', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the (quite large) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don’t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment, you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Then by then the food is cold', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Frequently saw 2-3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['stirring up lots of insects', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['I don’t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn’t enjoyable to sit by the pool', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['But we still would come back for the rooms, gym and food', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['If it weren’t for the pool experience being unpleasant, I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation', 'Branding', 'Neutral'], ['It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes', 'Service', 'Negative']]

271055,Our experience at Zizi homestay in Sapa was a spiritual journey that allowed us to witness the sacred rituals and beliefs of the Hmong community. The lodge, surrounded by towering peaks, provided a breathtaking setting for our trek. The guided trek led us through sacred sites, ancient temples, and shared moments of spiritual reflection. Each step felt like a step towards embracing the sacred wisdom of Hmong culture. The reverent hosts guided us through traditional ceremonies, offering us insight into their spiritual practices. Back at the lodge, we were treated to a sacred ritual, witnessing the deep reverence the Hmong have for their ancestors and nature. As the sun set, we gathered for a contemplative meditation session, enveloped in the profound tranquility of the mountains. While our overall experience was fantastic, some guests noticed occasional water supply disruptions, which added to the rustic charm but might cause minor inconveniences. However, it became an opportunity to appreciate the sacred connection the lodge has with nature and the mountains.

Just 10 minutes from the beach with grab (4 Seater ca 65k dong to get there)Very good coffe just at the corner, within 200 m supermarket, great sandwich (Banh my).

270621,The food and service staff were all excellent. I found the booking process very irritating, I received several Whats App calls and texts in the days before the cruise from the sales consultant Hang Nga telling me she had a big problem because she had double booked my room, she wanted me to spend one night in a cheaper room then move to my original booked room for the second night. I found her texts to be increasingly bizarre and late at night. She then told me she had a sick child and needed my help. She then offered to buy me a drink in Hanoi if I would just accept her plan to use the cheaper room. She was concerned about her job and realised she had made a big mistake. I was paying a lot of money for this cruise and did not want to move rooms. I told her it was her problem and she would have to fix it. I was traveling with friends and wanted to treat myself to a nice room on this cruise. Her constant texts caused me al lot of unnecessary stress in the days before getting on the cruise. The 2nd day outing wasn't very interesting. The tour guide for the day was annoying and kept asking for a tip. ####[['The food and service staff were all excellent', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['I found the booking process very irritating', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The tour guide for the day was annoying and kept asking for a tip', 'Service', 'Negative']]

274995,We stayed 3 days and 2 nights. The couple and the staff is really friendly. We asked for vegetarian dinners, which is not common, and the lady cooked several delicious things. We weren't pressured at all to spend more than we wanted (on drinks or meals).The family room we got was comfortable and clean. The room was equipped with 2 fans working well. The view on the rice terrasses from the balcony is beautiful. You may encounter insects or spiders in the bathroom or the room but much much fewer than in another place (HSP L) where we slept a previous night, thanks to the construction style of the buildings. The swimming pool is really appreciated by the customers... But also by friends or acquaintances of the homestay family. So be prepared to get some animation (with loud music) on some afternoons. Like all hotels in the area, be aware that it is isolated, so you're a captive customer because they aren't real restaurants in the area and you need to be an experienced motocycler to travel around. Still you can get great views on rice terrasses with reasonable walking distance but the most beautiful part is probably up North, closer to Vinh Quang, Hoang Su Phi town centre. ####[['The couple and the staff is really friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['We asked for vegetarian dinners, which is not common, and the lady cooked several delicious things', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The family room we got was comfortable and clean', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The room was equipped with 2 fans working well', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The view on the rice terrasses from the balcony is beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['You may encounter insects or spiders in the bathroom or the room', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The swimming pool is really appreciated by the customers', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["you're a captive customer", 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["they aren't real restaurants in the area", 'Service', 'Negative'], ['you need to be an experienced motocycler to travel around', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['Still you can get great views on rice terrasses with reasonable walking distance', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

274238,We stayed at Golden Holiday for a few days, in a total of 3 rooms. I'm going to give you lots of details about our stay, so you can see if it is right for you. Short story - we really enjoyed it!First the rooms - rooms are quite large, with very nice sheets, towels, pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers. We're not talking super high-end, but for the price the rooms are great. Some rooms have a small sofa - ask if your room has one, or request one. Wi-fi worked great> Toilets worked well, with nice bidets attached. If you want a large, comfortable room - I don't think you can go wrong here. Staff - staff are great. This place is well staffed, there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk, always willing to go out of their way for you. Especially Thuy and Ms. Kim - they are fantastic and will help make your stay very enjoyable. They often called "electric shuttles" for us, which worked well for transporting 5 people from 1 - 3km away. Breakfast - there is a large breakfast buffet available every day from 7 to 10AM. Ours was included in the room rates. There was great coffee, also fruits, salads, asian, and some western items. Some days there were bacon and chocolate crossaints. You could always get eggs cooked anyway you liked. No pancakes or waffles, but I don't think these are very common in Vietnam. It was easy to grab some pastries to go from the breakfast buffet so you had some snacks for later on. Pool - there was a medium sized pool outside. It was nice, clean - not super huge but large enough to do laps in it. Location - it is located right on a semi-busy street, but we never heard noise from our rooms, as it is set back a bit from the road. There are plenty of spas and restaurants in the area - but you are outside of the super busy, noisy "old town" tourist area. It is a quick 5 min electric shuttle ride ($2 usd) or a 22 minute walk to the main "old town" walking areas. ####[['we really enjoyed it', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' rooms are quite large, with very nice sheets, towels, pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["We're not talking super high-end, but for the price the rooms are great", 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Some rooms have a small sofa', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' Wi-fi worked great', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Toilets worked well, with nice bidets attached', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['staff are great', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['This place is well staffed, there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk, always willing to go out of their way for you.

The staff were super helpful and friendly during my stay. They recommended some cafes with awesome view and try their best to fulfill my request. This homestay serve vegan food for lunch and dinner. I tried their local Vietnamese style began food and it was delicious. The chef has many years of working experience in hospitality line. She worked in 5-stars resorts in South East Asia and Middle East. As it was low season due to covid-19, the owner took extra mile by offering me a personal trip from Sapa to Y Ty when i asked him for tour package. It was a wonderful experience although the journey was not easy for me.

273731,We had a great and extremely comfortable stay at this hotel. First of all the hotel is just at a 10 mins walkable distance from old town, lantern lake, japanese bridge etc which makes it a perfect location. In terms of cleanliness, room size and amenities as well I'd rate the hotel excellent. The hotel staff is extremely courteous and friendly. A special mention to the receptionist 'Nga'' she is very humble and ensures the guests have a very good experience. She understands and speaks English which makes it easier to communicate and ask for any information as a tourist, she goes out of her way to help you out.

274401,This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach. The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach, but since the beach wasn't very busy, you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across. The resort itself is extensive but it doesn't feel too large; it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends, so these times are busy. The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps. There are plenty of beds around that pool and you can have drinks there. The restaurant is good, so spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option. The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration. On the whole, the design of the place is amazing, with plenty of Koi carp ponds, wooden carving, well-maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms. The staffs were amazing and it's really nice to talk to them (thank you Ann!). What has been the best for us was the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil, a nice pool, the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well (Covid had closed that down). It's worth it staying there for a week or more if you're looking for a relaxing pool/beach holiday, but for food you have to either use their restaurant, or use a few local restaurants nearby - or go into town, of course (which you have to as Hoi An is an amazing, but touristy, town!) It's not so much what we didn't like, but maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well. Also, the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient, but the last one back from town is at 17. 30, so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back, which is a bit of a hassle when it gets busy. ####[['This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['the design of the place is amazing, with plenty of Koi carp ponds, wooden carving, well-maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [" The staffs were amazing and it's really nice to talk to them", 'Service', 'Positive'], [' the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil, a nice pool, the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [" It's worth it staying there for a week or more if you're looking for a relaxing pool/beach holiday", 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well', 'Service', 'Neutral'], [' the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient, but the last one back from town is at 17. 30, so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The resort itself is extensive', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There are plenty of beds around that pool', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The restaurant is good', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' you can have drinks there', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["the beach wasn't very busy, you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across", 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends, so these times are busy', 'Experience', 'Neutral']]

270130,For our wedding anniversary celebration, my family decided to stay at this lovely resort called Memorina. And wow, did it surpass our expectations! Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery, it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape. The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat, bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region. We spent hours wandering around the resort, discovering charming nooks, admiring the vibrant plant life, and even giving fishing a shot. One of the highlights was visiting the sheepfold – an experience that not only captivated us but also filled our kids with wide-eyed wonder. Watching their faces light up as they interacted with the sheep was absolutely heartwarming. During our stay, we were treated to a gentle evening rain, which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand. All in all, our time at Memorina etched a truly special memory in our family's journey. ####[[' We spent hours wandering around the resort, discovering charming nooks, admiring the vibrant plant life, and even giving fishing a shot', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['it surpass our expectations', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['During our stay, we were treated to a gentle evening rain, which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ["our time at Memorina etched a truly special memory in our family's journey", 'Experience', 'Positive']]

270231,The hotel itself and the staff deserve a five star rating. The facilities of the hotel, the interior design, the standard of the rooms are high class. There is absolutely nothing missing to enjoy a wonderful stay. The Spa is well equipped, offers a great variety of treatments by experienced, well trained therapists. The restaurant on the basement floor offers a huge breakfast buffet, western and Asian style plus a menue. Lunch and dinner has separate menue with various dishes at reasonable prices. Service is attentive and especially at breakfast there is no request they wouldn't satisfy. Even for breakfast they ask for your allergies! There is a rooftop bar with happy hour and a view from the 5th floor. The other bar is in the lobby. My room offered much more than I expected: apart from safe, TV, hairdryer and water kettle, there is a fridge, free water, tea, coffee and fruits. The bed is so comfortable you don't want to get out, as is the linen and towels from very good quality. Enough plugs to recharge your electronic equipment. Lights are also good and enough.

A clean and comfy couch was very welcome after 4 hours on a motorbike in 36+ deg heat riding across the red river delta. We were so happy to kick back and use the excellent Samsung wide screen smart tv as the ducted AC quickly cooled the room with dry air. The AC was so good it dried our clothes over night as it rained outside. The samsung washing machine was an excellent feature and the staff kindly gifted us some laundry liquid. The rest of the bathroom was well equipped and clean. The bed was comfortable and extra wide. The entire apartment was very clean and offered sweeping views across downtown Haiphong. Breakfast is a buffet with made to order Banh Da Cua (crab noodle soup) and eggs plus all the other bits you want, and great coffee.

The breakfast is plentiful and delicious, they have free bikes for use at any time, they offer free foot baths which we used and they brought to our rooms. Upon returning from a day out on their bikes we received a knock on our room door, and they had brought cold juices for us! I commented on their homemade pineapple jam, and received a jar of it to take away with me, and on our departure day the gave us water and snacks to take with us on our long journey. Thank you Tam Coc Bungalows you are simply amazing!

275113,I love the location of the homestay which is near to lots of attractions. With the free bicycles, we could reach those places easily. The owner or caretaker was also very friendly and helpful. Generous to check us in a few hours earlier and check us out one hour later. Always giving out free water bottles and helped us to book the limousine van back to Hanoi. The bed in the room looks like a super king size! Shower was great too. Breakfast was good. Booking. com upgraded us to a room with three beds and lots of windows but we were given another room with only one bed and one window. Which was fine by us as we are only a couple but would love to have a corner lot unit for more sunlight.

Would highly recommend staying here with such a lovely family if you are looking for perfect accommodation in Tam Coc, which is near tourist attractions but not “touristy” in itself. The only thing (if we were to be SERIOUSLY fussy!!) was that the plastic was left on the mattress from when it was delivered.

They even had a coffee pod machine and provided decaf pods which was amazing for me as I had not been able to get decaf anywhere else! The gym is great with good facilities, we had a lovely massage at the spa, and the pool area is gorgeous it’s just such a shame we couldn’t enjoy it as the weather was sadly terrible for entire duration of our stay!

276283,It was a short stay, but very nice. The location itself is absolutely beautiful, with a nice garden with lots of plants, small pool, small ponds with water lily, very idilic. Thong and his wife are great people, very welcoming and helpful. Thong's mum is the one cooking and the food is simply delicious. Many of the guests choose to skip the breakfast at the Eco Lodge, in order to have the traditional noodle soup at the floating market. But we were so happy we chose to have breakfast here. At the floating market it is crowded, and i am unsure how clean everything is, as everything is washed with water from the river. But we made the best choice having breakfast cooked by Thong's mum. They also arranged floating market tour and taxi back to Saigon through their travel agent, Lily. All were extremly helpful. Please just be aware that at times it can get noisy if there is a wedding party nearby or any kind of celebration for that matter as karaoke will be sung to mark the occasion. Not only here, I mean, but in all areas of Mekong delta, as we were staying in diffrrent locations, to see different parts of the Delta. Best to have some ear plugs, just in case. Otherwise, please do not skip this accomodation, as it is beautiful. One suggestion: maybe some hammocks would be nice to have in the garden. ####[['It was a short stay, but very nice', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The location itself is absolutely beautiful, with a nice garden with lots of plants, small pool, small ponds with water lily, very idilic', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Thong and his wife are great people, very welcoming and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["Thong's mum is the one cooking and the food is simply delicious", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['we were so happy we chose to have breakfast here', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["we made the best choice having breakfast cooked by Thong's mum", 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Please just be aware that at times it can get noisy if there is a wedding party nearby or any kind of celebration for that matter as karaoke will be sung to mark the occasion', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['please do not skip this accomodation, as it is beautiful', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['some hammocks would be nice to have in the garden', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

270482,Comfortable bed. Clean rooms. Great location. Pool was nice. Brutal check out experience. They advertise 24 hour reception so I thought nothing of checking out early in the morning to catch my 6 AM bus to the airport. There was nobody in reception except a security guard who, upon my spouse and I loading our bags onto the bus, proceeded to make a scene (yelling at myself and the driver) that I had yet to pay. I went inside to pay and found out he (security guard) could not administer payment. He had trouble getting ahold of the man in charge of reception. Meanwhile my bus driver was beginning to unload our things and was attempting to kick us off the bus as we were now behind schedule. I pleaded to him, explaining that the hotel had my credit info and I could be billed, and made the same plea to the security guard. To no avail. I was now refusing to get off the bus because I had a flight to catch, and caught between two men screaming at eachother and at me. I'm not sure I've faced that level of anxiety before in my life. All due to a false promise of 24 hour reception. Anyway, don't rely on the 24 hour reception, and don't expect to be treated with common decency by the staff (this doesn't apply to the guy working reception, he was actually kind and respectful). ####[['Comfortable bed.

The hotel has free bicycle rental and also has scooters for hire for a reasonable daily fee. We rented the scooters on 2 different days and they did not require proof of a license, nor to fill out forms. The only downside is the location which is almost at the end of the bay.

274345,The boat itself is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay. It feels magical. The staff were extremely kind and welcoming. We did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized. Kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in Vietnam. All the food was quite good and was included. But, FYI if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise. The staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood. The baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window, so you can look out at the bay, which is great. This ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay. The balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures. No drinks are included and although they have a buy 2 get 1 free happy hour, the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying it would be nice if they were included.

Vy (not sure if I have the spelling right) and Hanna were the standouts, they went out of their way to ask about our stay and give very personalized tips while here. But really all the staff went above and beyond for us. The hotel is a short walk (or even shorter bike ride) into the old town. I really felt at home here. The only issue we had was with the bikes.

Breakfast room was very good, Western and Asian choices, as was the service both at the desk and in breakfast room. Rooms were very clean, comfortable beds with great showers, both rainfall and handheld. Maybe only disappointment for myself was pool, but it's a good pool, very large with a small one to the side, I just prefer the open air one especially with that view. Proximity to everything at the core of Nha Trang, steps from the beach and restaurants and bars. I'll definitely return.

Mr Trung was so sweet always sharing his fruit with us and when we left sent us off with apples and water bottles. He even drove us to the bus stop because we couldn’t find a grab to take us. Mrs Phuong woke up to let us in when we arrived at 1am and gave us a lovely room. They had an elevator as well which was heaven for us after being up 5 flights of stairs in Hanoi! The room was clean, spacious and had a balcony, TV and refrigerator. The hotel is right opposite the train station so easy to get to. We rented bikes from them for only 100K a day, Mrs Phuong gave me a quick lesson as I hadn’t rode for years. Overall a lovely stay and would recommend to anyone. Hosts so kind, helpful and generous as well as a lovely hotel for such a good price!

Really, everything was great.

The beach is at 10 min walk and 3 in the motorcycle. If you rent one they'll let you park it inside the homestay. It's possible to wake up every morning and swim in the ocean (I did). You can order your breakfast (made to order), go to the beach, swim and when you come back, it's waiting for you in the room, where you can enjoy it in the spacious AC Room. I was able to leave my heavy luggage with them for 3 days, at no charge, I recommend tipping though, this is a true Homestay (they live next door), they are building it up based on our visits. Quiet and a breath of fresh air (ironically in a superhot & humid weather) compared to downtown Hoi An. 15min motorcycle ride through an amazing landscape (see photos). You can find better? probably (closer to the beach... i saw a couple of places, but it's hard to beat the value. Nothing ####[['The son speaks English, the parents do not, but they are sweethearts.

We were at this resort in 2018 and things were totally different then. It was way better organized. For example the restaurant logistics; Meals are not served at the same time, so you eat alone instead of with your partner. Meals are very little of size, not of Western standards. Breakfast has to be reserved 24 hours before. Thats good for foodwaste, but unfortunally you mostly don't get what you ordered. And the quality of the breakfast could be much better. (Old, hard toast, cold pancakes, milky yoghurt etc.). The staff in the restaurant are really really nice but unexperienced.

From helping us book taxis, tours (we booked Golden Bridge), laundry services, massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning, they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional. They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight! This hotel is located halfway between An Bang Beach and Hoi An Old Town, in a peaceful, tranquil rural setting. It’s ideally situated for day trips like basket boat tours and even Tra Que Culinary Village. We loved being able to see the farmers work the land in this authentic setting and walking to nearby little cafés. We used the free bicycles to explore the area a few times, which was very pleasant. It would be a quick 10-15 minute bike ride into town. The pool was a little too cold for us during our one week stay in February, but it was still lovely to sit around on the comfy loungers and listen to the trickling water, like a little oasis. The gentleman who works on the grounds doesn’t speak English, but he works very hard to maintain the property, is the hotel’s security, gardener and I’m sure whatever else needs doing. Our hats off to him! We Canadians highly recommend this little gem of a hotel just outside the busy area. We’d like to thank the staff at Maison Fleur Hoi An for a wonderful stay! Occasionally we had to be patient to get a Grab taxi to come and pick us up at the property as it's a little out of the way. But this is also part of why we liked the hotel. ####[['check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Our room was well appointed', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' just as pictured in the photos', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Both the ladies at reception, Xí and Vân, took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['From helping us book taxis, tours (we booked Golden Bridge), laundry services, massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning, they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight!

The staff were not always attentive and one morning left a large spillage next to the breakfast table for around 45 mins after we alerted them and we had to ask them second time to clean it up to avoid risk of someone slipping. The staff also didn’t automatically clear up breakfast tables outside the restaurant and as they didn’t speak English, they couldn’t understand that we were asking them to clear up a table after previous guests so that we could sit there. finally they understood but then they didn’t lay the table with any crockery and cutlery so we had to ask again.

We had an evening meal after a long day out and it was exceptional, lots of menu choices, beautifully presented and very delicious. The hotel explains that whilst it is in a convenient part of the city, the views and space are not as good as the larger hotels but it makes up for that by providing excellent care and dedication and believe me that is exactly what they do. Nothing is too much trouble and all the staff go the extra mile to make your stay pleasurable.

This also created the extra trouble of having to change room the next day. Breakfast was basic and by 8am, there is hardly any food left. Rooftop swimming pool was not available for use.

274706,I had an absolutely wonderful stay at this apartment. The location was amazing, with a plethora of authentic local food options just a 5-minute walk away. However, the highlight for me was the stunning pool, where I spent many relaxing moments and admired the beautiful surroundings. Additionally, sitting on the balcony and enjoying a drink was a delightful experience. Hannah, the host, was simply fantastic. She was incredibly kind and helpful throughout my stay, providing valuable suggestions on local attractions and activities. Thanks to Hannah's support, I had an incredible travel experience without any issues. I am genuinely satisfied with my stay and cannot wait to return. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone seeking a memorable vacation. Not only does it boast an excellent location, but it is also comfortable and well-equipped. I had plenty of space to relax and make the most of my holiday. The balcony offered a lovely spot to take in the scenery and enjoy breakfast or an evening beverage.

271933,Fantastic location, right near the markets and some great local restaurants. There is an excellent family restaurant to the left of the hotel which we loved. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and kind and welcoming. Due to long flight delays we didn't arrive at the hotel until almost 5am and the gentleman was awaiting our arrival. Bedding and towels were clean and comfortable. I was happy to see large mugs for making a coffee or tea, which was a welcome change to the smaller cups usually provided in hotels. I travel with my own travel mug for that reason. All in all we were pleased with our stay.

271683,the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish, the owner and the staff generally polite, friendly and helpful. i was offered free tea during check-in and check-out. good communication via whatsapp, the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in. on arrival my scooter was brought to a safe place and they also took care of my keys and gear. Unfortunately there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds. On arrival I was warned of the nocturnal noise from the street - to be fair, before paying. However, the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs, even the mattress vibrated (and that was on the 4th floor, not directly at the street and on a tuesday) - not the hotels fault, but guests should be aware of this. After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff, they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel (30k) saying it couldn't be reused anymore (!). after i asked if it's possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away, they wanted to bill me for 200k. I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet. i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules. ####[['the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' the owner and the staff generally polite, friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['i was offered free tea during check-in and check-out', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['good communication via whatsapp, the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff, they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel (30k) saying it couldn't be reused anymore ", 'Service', 'Negative'], [" i asked if it's possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away, they wanted to bill me for 200k", 'Service', 'Negative'], [' I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules', 'Service', 'Negative']]

The 2 rooms were MASSIVE and so clean and welcoming. Great location being a night walking street on weekends so fabulous to get some street food. Easy to get to the sites and wander around.

Vihn (I think that’s his name , the only male front concierge) can work on his customer service skills.

270122,They were all very nice, and the hotel is really central. We arrived late at night, so we asked for a transfer from the airport. The lady was very nice to us, but we realised that we would pay 400. 000 vd, which is a lot for this transfer from the airport. (If we had gone by taxi, we would pay only around 130. 000 vd...) When we got to the hotel, a really nice man was there to receive us. The small room that we booked had no windows, so we upgraded to the bigger room. The hotel is OK, not fancy (we have to watch out for the cockroachs), but it's really central, and we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night, and also the air-conditioning machine outside (which is normal in Vietnam). When we were leaving, we asked the man if he could please call a taxi, and we expected no more fees from the hotel. Until we realised that the lady came to collect our money, saying that her car would take us to the airport (for 220. 000 vd). Of course, it was not her car, and she paid the taxi and got a fee from our money. We're not sure how much she paid the taxi, but it should be around 120. 000 vd, and the rest of the 100. 000 vd went to her pocket. It wasn't correct of her, and we felt robbed. I'd definitely not recommend this hotel, and if you do stay there, ALWAYS GET A TAXI YOURSELF, or give the extra money to the person that actually drives you.. ####[['They were all very nice', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['the hotel is really central', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The lady was very nice to us', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['but we realised that we would pay 400. 000 vd, which is a lot for this transfer from the airport', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['When we got to the hotel, a really nice man was there to receive us', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' The small room that we booked had no windows, so we upgraded to the bigger room', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The hotel is OK, not fancy ', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night, and also the air-conditioning machine outside', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], [' we realised that the lady came to collect our money, saying that her car would take us to the airport (for 220. 000 vd).

She helped us book a cruise trip to Ha Long Bay, but my mother fell in on the way required her to be hospitalised in a town half way there. “My” helped us book a car at reasonable rates from Hanoi to pick us up after our mother was discharged from the hospital. Other members of staff were also very helpful with exchanging money and recommending good places to visit. The hotel is conveniently located, near many trendy coffee shops, local restaurants and the famous Bahn Mi 25 sandwich shop. We had a family room with one double bed and one queen bed. Shower had good water pressure also. The first room was quite dark, but I asked if we could change rooms and they immediately allowed us to change to a brighter room without any fuss whatsoever. So not really a negative. ####[['The service at this hotel is exceptional', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The hotel manager, “My” was unbelievably great', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['She always enquired about our stay, was always helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['went out of her way to help us in a family emergency that required one of us to go to the hospital', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['She helped us book a cruise trip to Ha Long Bay', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['“My” helped us book a car at reasonable rates from Hanoi to pick us up after our mother was discharged from the hospital', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['staff were also very helpful with exchanging money', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['recommending good places to visit', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The hotel is conveniently located, near many trendy coffee shops, local restaurants and the famous Bahn Mi 25 sandwich shop', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Shower had good water pressure', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['We had a family room with one double bed and one queen bed', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I asked if we could change rooms and they immediately allowed us to change', 'Service', 'Positive']]
275072,The hotel is really close to the city center. It has been clean and the person on the reception has been really nice. The bed was comfortable. There was black mold growing on the wall in the bathroom right above the shower. I know that the weather is wet and hot but that needs to be cleaned and removed (no way you can not see this bc it took me only a short time after our arrival). The street is really loud so don’t expect that you can open a window at night to have some fresh air. We had a room in the second floor with a window but unfortunately there has been the air conditioning systems (and also a lot of trash) right in front of our window so it has been loud 24/7. ####[['The hotel is really close to the city center', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['It has been clean', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the person on the reception has been really nice', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The bed was comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There was black mold growing on the wall in the bathroom right above the shower', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The street is really loud so don’t expect that you can open a window at night to have some fresh air', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['a lot of trash', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['it has been loud 24/7', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

Our room had absolutely nothing to do with the pictures! Ask them to show you the room at least before paying. It was DISGUSTING staying at this place, such an overpiced hotel! Dont waste your money here!The good rating in Booking is probably due to the staff actively asking you to put them a review of 10 when you leave…The only positive thing is the staff is helpful, even though many of them dont speak english ####[['Staff was nice', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['REALLY DIRTY, with many traces from other customers', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The room was very small', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' it didnt even have a proper window', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The only window was facing a wall, so it was claustrophobic', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['It was DISGUSTING staying at this place, such an overpiced hotel', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['Dont waste your money here', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['The only positive thing is the staff is helpful, even though many of them dont speak english', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Our room had absolutely nothing to do with the pictures', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Ask them to show you the room at least before paying', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

We stayed 3 nights, coffee was between tepid and cold all 3 days, even when it was "brought in fresh".Internet really slow in room and kept disconnecting (getting used to that -minor issue)Bathrooms need to be cleaned better, soap holder had remnants of atleast 3 different soaps in it. ####[['Fantastic staff', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast was in the building next door and had what we thought were a good selection of both Western and Asian', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Rooms were large and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Location is great', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['We had a room at the back so was not bothered by noise from the walking street', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast service is a bit hit and miss', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['Internet really slow in room and kept disconnecting', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Bathrooms need to be cleaned better, soap holder had remnants of atleast 3 different soaps in it', 'Facility', 'Negative']]
273383,We were received by Mr. Danh and his wife, who both run this motel. Such a warm and friendly welcome! They even texted us before our arrival to check if we had any trouble locating the property. We were doing a motorcycle trip in Vietnam, and were riding from Hue to Hoi An. Decided to stop by Canh Duong Motel for a night's rest. Motel is easy to locate on Google Maps, situated next to a beach with PLENTY of seafood restaurants to choose from. Mr Danh is very friendly and an excellent host - he also speaks good English so communication was no problem. Mr Danh actually lives in the community, so he provided great guide to the local eateries and roads which was useful for us. Our room had very clean and shiny tiled floors, large bathroom with great water pressure and heated water. Air-conditioning worked very well. Many reviews highlighted the firm bed, but it is actually firm yet comfortable! Power socket points were convenient. Accomodation was perfect! Thank you Mr Danh! ####[['Such a warm and friendly welcome', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They even texted us before our arrival to check if we had any trouble locating the property', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' Motel is easy to locate on Google Maps, situated next to a beach with PLENTY of seafood restaurants to choose from', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Mr Danh is very friendly and an excellent host - he also speaks good English so communication was no problem', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Mr Danh actually lives in the community, so he provided great guide to the local eateries and roads which was useful for us', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Our room had very clean and shiny tiled floors', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' large bathroom with great water pressure and heated water', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Air-conditioning worked very well', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Power socket points were convenient', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Many reviews highlighted the firm bed, but it is actually firm yet comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' Accomodation was perfect', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

274428,Wonderful time here! While trekking through the jungle, Mr. Co taught me how to use my sense to navigate and search in there. Sometimes, after silently chasing a gibbon family by following their sound, we stayed at the same spot for 15 minutes just to watch their activity. That time we feel like we are a part of the jungle. Homestay's facilities are good. You are also served by two other receptionists (a dog and her child). They will welcome you in the morning when you open your room and notify you when the food is ready.

It was a bit hard for me to find out where it was because it was covered by the trees and there are several homestays around that place.

I have no idea why the price on the rooms were still high due to the constructions, also the door is very thin. I asked stuff to make a deal with the construction workers or change the room or give me money back. They changed the room the same day without any concern, but even in the other room i could still hear the noise.

There is such kind staff in the breakfast, so attentive to be sure the guests are comfortable and happy. My bed and pillows were so comfortable (standard double room) and a really nice marble shower. I did not have a window but i wouldn’t have opened it bc the a/c was on and i wouldn’t want to let mosquitos in. The room did not need a window, it felt very open and nice and very sweetly furnished — the designer of the hotel had very good taste. Especially the huge fuchsia colored chandelier in the lobby!

270048,First impressions - amazing use of space and a great meet and greet. Breakfast - excellent, very fresh and different each day Laundry service - free and done for you, which is just great! Location - whilst not the most central location, the host got us taxi's as we couldn't use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim! We also used Google maps and the local bus, which is very cheap and reliable! So I didn't find location as issue at all. My husband loved the free gym! Whilst we did love our stay I feel it necessary to talk about what we didn't like. This place doesn't know what it wants yo be! It's guests are mainly young English teachers who actually live there medium to long term, so it's their home! We felt a bit like we were staying in their house. They are young, and with that came lots of night time noise, and socialising with friends not guests of the homestay right under our window until 2am on a couple of occasions. I expect young people to be noisy, it's normal, but I felt at the cost to other guests. This is because the place is mixed with different types of guests, and doesn't really have a true identity. This mixed with a very hard uncomfortable bed equaled a major lack of sleep for me! However, we did still enjoy our booking, but I feel this feedback is necessary for mid age guests, where noise might be an issue. ####[['amazing use of space and a great meet and greet', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast - excellent, very fresh and different each day', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Laundry service - free and done for you, which is just great', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Location - whilst not the most central location', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], [" the host got us taxi's as we couldn't use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['My husband loved the free gym', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' we did love our stay', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['we did still enjoy our booking', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

272185,New hotel, very friendly staff - they want that your rest would be beautiful and do it, tell you all about Da Nang, things and give advice where you can go and what you can see. Hotel placed outside of loud center, near are more fish restaurants, bars, and snacks points. Hotel placed in first line (need cross the way) and you can swim anytime any where, look at the fishers, take a sup or kayak etc. We took a motorbike (in hotel) and across all around. For motorbike is enough your driver license (with B category), no need special license (for example A category or Vietnam license). Our recommendation what you should see: Da Nang bridges, Lady Buddha, Marmor mountains, and of course Ba na hils - for our opinion the Golden bridge is too advertised, but everything else is just fantastic - castles on top of the mountain, Buddhist temples and statues, pagodas, various gardens - just amazing!!!, attractions (everything is included in the ticket price) - this will definitely not leave you indifferent. This is not a negative comment, but just a small nuance - the toilet is located in your room behind an opaque glass partition - you do not have to be a stiff family to live here :) ####[['Hotel placed outside of loud center, near are more fish restaurants, bars, and snacks points', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['the toilet is located in your room behind an opaque glass partition', 'Facility', 'Neutral']]

271433,Good location around 5 minutes from the beach. The rooftop pool had a good view across the city. The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con, comfy bed, fridge, toiletries. The hotel was very noisy. We had a large family who used the hallway and lift as a playground, with the children screaming and crying while the parents shouted up and down the hallway from 5. 30am until midnight each day. We told reception who didn't care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy. There are alarms on the hotel bedroom doors as they are awkward to close, the alarms are good for safety however the other rooms would leave their doors open with the alarms beeping from early until late which again kept us awake. The hotel is not 4*, more 2 or 3*, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating. The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily. The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up. We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym, just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment, no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill. There are lots of hotels in the area - I wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price. ####[['Good location around 5 minutes from the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The rooftop pool had a good view across the city.', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con, comfy bed, fridge, toiletries', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The hotel was very noisy', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["We told reception who didn't care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy", 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The hotel is not 4*, more 2 or 3*, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym, just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment, no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['I wish we had chosen somewhere else for the price', 'Branding', 'Negative']]

273575,rien My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare. From the outset, the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous. The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic English. In a highly unprofessional move, he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking. com platform, promising “better apartments, better views, and more check-in options.” He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times! And after reading reviews from previous guests, I discovered that those who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn’t get any of the promised benefits. The deceit didn’t stop there. On the check-in day, the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower. This was a complete bait and switch, and it left us feeling utterly duped. To add insult to injury, the apartment itself was a disaster. The furniture was old, worn, and filthy, and the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online. It was smaller, older, and lacked any charm or modern decoration. The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding. As if that weren’t enough, the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay. We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water. It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard. In short, our stay at Landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism. I urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere. It’s simply not worth the stress, frustration, and betrayal. ####[['My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic Englis', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['In a highly unprofessional move, he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking. com platform, promising “better apartments, better views, and more check-in options', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times!', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn’t get any of the promised benefits', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The deceit didn’t stop there', 'Service', 'Negative'], [' the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['This was a complete bait and switch', 'Service', 'Negative'], [' it left us feeling utterly duped', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' the apartment itself was a disaster', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The furniture was old, worn, and filthy', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online', 'Branding', 'Negative'], ['It was smaller, older, and lacked any charm or modern decoration.', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' our stay at Landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['I urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], [' It’s simply not worth the stress, frustration, and betrayal', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

274178,Our room was great- large, all wood, with a balcony facing the valley and a hot tub in the bathroom. Staff were super friendly and helpful. It was a positive that the lodge was out of the city of Sa Pa, giving us lots of peace and quiet. The lodge restaurant served a wide variety of dishes and the quality was very good. It's a bit costly to get from the hotel to the town of Sa Pa - about $9 each way in taxi and although the lodge has a good view of the valley, it is built right on a main road. Can't say enough about how friendly and helpful staff were, but the level of English was often poor, and thus getting answers to questions about sites to visit, places to go, and things to do, were often confusing and contradictory. ####[['Our room was great- large, all wood, with a balcony facing the valley and a hot tub in the bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Staff were super friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['It was a positive that the lodge was out of the city of Sa Pa, giving us lots of peace and quiet', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The lodge restaurant served a wide variety of dishes and the quality was very good', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["It's a bit costly to get from the hotel to the town of Sa Pa - about $9 each way in taxi", 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' the lodge has a good view of the valley', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['it is built right on a main road', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [" Can't say enough about how friendly and helpful staff were", 'Service', 'Positive'], [' but the level of English was often poor', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['and thus getting answers to questions about sites to visit, places to go, and things to do, were often confusing and contradictory', 'Service', 'Negative']]

271626,Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely, airy, clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea. The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city, particularly at night. The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter's birthday (highly recommend for a fun afternoon/evening) Breakfast is great in the hotel, but there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about. Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night. Be prepared though as it was very busy on all the surrounding streets, so if you don't like crowds, you'll have to see the fire-breathing from a distance !! This is isn't a criticism of the hotel, but be aware there is a lot of development going on in Da Nang and lots of construction site. On one of the days there was a lot of drilling and banging coming from a nearby site and there is a stage on the beach directly below the hotel that plays loud music most night until 11pm. Also be prepared for noise form the street outside (tooting of horns, etc) and also the fact the beach is packed at 5. 30am with people watching the sunrise. None of these things can be controlled by the hotel though and they didn't detract from our stay. In short, if you want peace and quiet Da Nang is probably not the place for you.... ####[['Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely, airy, clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city, particularly at night', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter's birthday ", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast is great in the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

As it was a fault from their end for 2500 INR per night they upgraded our room to villa. We enjoyed preparing Indian food in their kitchen. Washing machine was available for laundry. Villa was spacious with 2 rooms and living hall. We asked about bike rental she immediately provided bike keys. Since there was a language barrier as soon as we call her she was coming near property I had messaged about arrival as it was not seen by owner, owner was not available near property when we arrived. Neighbour of that property helped us to communicate with her as she doesnt speak English. It took 15 mins for her to arrive near property till that time her neighbour provided chairs to wait near their house. Bed is hard like a rock.

Welcomed us on day one and shared lots of info about the resort and also places to go and things to do. Organised our airport transfers and also our tour to Ba Na Hills, as well as taxi's on request. Resort was amazing and the restuarant food was really enjoyable. Only a short taxi ride into the Ancient Town so great location, without being stuck surrounded by tourists. Wish we stayed here longer. I mentioned to staff, our shower took a long time to get hot water, and it didn't work out of the top shower head (only really from the hand-held one).

The tiled floor in the room looked spotless but under the bed there was all sort of rubbish (incl. a dead cockroach) that would fly around when the window was open. There is just one socket just on one side of the bed. The a/c pointed right at the bed head making very uncomfortable to sleep. The balcony was just 300mm deep, not made to sit outside nor hang your towel after being at the beach. The handrail was totally rusty. The view from every window of the building opens on the rubbish thrown in the perimeter land. The toliet sit is 5fingers smaller than the toilet itself. Shower water runs weak but it works incl. hot water. Very poor breakfast incl. coffee, tea, bread, ham and some fruit. Some staff members din't speak english and they din't make any effort to understand me. Once they knew I was up in the morning, the cleaning staff invaded my room ignoring if I still wanted to stay in the room. It happened to me at 8am.

273965,I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential. With its prime location opposite the beach, attentive staff, and impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products, my overall experience was positive. While the hotel showed promise in many aspects, the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay. I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel's recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time. It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences. However, considering the hotel had only been operational for two weeks, this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy. ####[['I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' its prime location opposite the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], [' attentive staff', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products, my overall experience was positive', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay', 'Service', 'Negative'], [" I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel's recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time", 'Service', 'Negative'], [' It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences', 'Service', 'Neutral'], [' this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy', 'Service', 'Neutral']]

The rooftop bar and pool are one big reason to stay here.

The beach view rooms come with one little drawback: music playing through the night on the beach audible even on the higher floors with windows closed. For guests with light sleep, city view might be a good consideration (not a bad view anyhow - see photo). Closing time of the rooftop bar at 22:00 is something guests have to count with.

The man then told us we dont need that much time to be at the airport. And tried pushing us back to 2. We compromised for 1. 45.

I have had amazing experiences with the tours booked by the hostel. Special shoutout to Nancy, for being so nice and helpful throughout our stay.

Very tasteful design, all the facilities you need, super comfortable. Near perfect! And the Hu Tieu we went out for, especially with loads of extra garlic and that sweet-and-salty, slightly spicy sauce, YUM!! Everything was absolutely great, except for 1 detail (I don't believe in perfection anyway, so a 10 is impossible in any case): the only thing was that the living room is not separated from the stairway, so with people downstairs speaking, even while being on the second floor, I could very clearly hear them. Just a minor thing, but still worth a mention for me. ####[['Great house, hidden away but still in a very nice area', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Simply amazing host/s sharing their own place, and being extremely helpful and kind', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Very tasteful design, all the facilities you need, super comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the living room is not separated from the stairway, so with people downstairs speaking, even while being on the second floor, I could very clearly hear them', 'Facility', 'Negative']]

274346,The location of this hostel is good, about a 10 minute motorbike ride from the beach and there are some lovely local bars, restaurants and tailors in the surrounding area as well. The staff were pleasant and friendly, with good recommendations and great English skills. They switched us to a different room quickly and without a hassle when my friend and I didn't want to share our hostel room with loud guests. This hostel is very dominated by English backpackers and so it caters to a very party/drinking oriented crowd, so if this is not what you're looking for this is probably not the place for you. While the pool is a nice addition, it's rather small. The breakfast provided was really lacking variety though, and what they did have was not very nice. We were also given stained towels to use and when we asked for new ones they were stained as well.

Apart from the western menu, rest of the food was exceptional. This is the one of the beautiful resort, I have stayed. Usually we are going to the beachside, not countryside. Therefore, I really enjoyed the view and the climate. The quality of the Western food that served in the resort was not that good. Foe example, we had BBQ Pork Ribs which were really hard to cut the meat and not that taste. Usually this is not the case. Also, the reception staff is lack of communication. We booked a car for airport drop off much more early, but we were picked up after 30 mins late. So it seems the staff did not do the proper communications with the driver.

270471,The staff are so friendly and helpful. They really want to help you make the most of Da Lat and have lots of helpful suggestions. We were able to book our onwards bus tickets through the hotel. The included breakfast is tasty, with several choices, and you are welcome to more, which is nice. Lots of cute dogs live at the guesthouse!The room was a nice size and had everything we needed. There was no AC but the room had a fan, and as Da Lat is so cool at night, you didn't miss AC. The guesthouse is well located and there are lots of nice shops, little coffee shops, bars and restaurants nearby. Not too far from the night market, maybe 10 minutes by foot. It's great value for money! The bathroom was connected to the one next door and so we could hear everything that the guests next door were saying. It's worth noting that two of the dogs are very friendly and like being petted, but two of them are not. We observed them snapping at/biting several other guests who went to touch them a couple of times.

275808,The staff was lovely. Food was nice. Comfortable beds. First of all, it was tiny. We could barely fit our two suitcases in it. Secondly, there was no windows. From the windows we saw in photos one was to the bathroom, and the other one opened into the inside of the building (with mouldy walls). This meant that there was no fresh air, and the room was dark, hot and stuffy. Everything was moist and smelled like mould. Every morning we woke up with a headache and after a couple days started getting ill. Our clothes were constantly damp and smelly. Every evening we dreaded getting back to that room. Our toilet broke on the 3rd day and we were put in a different room for one night while they fixed it - that room was much nicer and didn’t smell, but the windows weren’t soundproof and we couldn’t sleep all night because of how loud it was. As we were pretty jet lagged we wanted to sleep in and left the Do Not Disturb sign on our door every morning, but every morning we were woken up by staff being loud outside our door. From around 7am to 11 there was always someone shouting, talking, making phone calls, hoovering etc, and we could hear everything like they were in our room. There were little ants everywhere. The shower door didn’t close. The room was cleaned every day but not very well.

274412,The pool is really gorgeous. We spent every afternoon relaxing, reading and swimming there. Loved our little bungalow with the beautiful bathroom. Very peaceful, beautiful resort and nice to watch the world go by on the river. We cycled into the town to eat seafood and pizza (both recommended and cheap!) and cycled to the island in the middle using bikes provided by the hotel for free. We came over the new year holiday and the resort hired lion dancers to come and dance and play drums from 7:20am to 8:20am two mornings in a row.

There are two pools and both are great place to relax after your day trips or instead of a day trip. Our friends spent some time on the beach area that is managed by the hotel and were pleased with everything there. The hotel provides free bikes. Breakfast is not varied and of average quality. The resort needs to make and effort to bring it to the rest of the experience. I knew that the resort is not close to the center but it turned to be much further than I imagined because it is impossible to get in a straight line to the old town due to the way Vietnamese cities are planned, or rather never planned at all. ####[['Very well maintained resort with helpful staff', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The rooms in the Villa part are big and very comfortable, especially those on eth first floor, where we stayed.

The property itself is to a high standard. Our studio apartment had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. comfy bed, great shower and lovely decor. As others have mentioned lovely coffee shop next door for the morning. The only point to raise is that it’s about 25min walk from old town and lots of attractions.

The room itself was just amazing, I liked the interior design, it had everything you need and every single detail is thought through. The bed was super comfy though the pillows were a bit tough for me. The owner of the hotel is a nice friendly lady, she even gave me a lift to the bus station! Overall it exceeded my expectations and I would definitely stay there again!

271396,Beautiful woody accommodation in the middle of the nature, with a stunning view of the paddy rice from the second floor balcony. The Thai food was also very good and cheap! Surelee, the owner has to change a little bit her attitude. I understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude. Her property, which she named a "homestay", doesn't quite reflect what a homestay should be, since, being Italians and having Italian dishes on the menu, we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused. Also, in my opinion she push to much the customers to purchase her trekking tour which are very expensive compared to the ones found walking by the villages. Finally, the 2 shared bathrooms were not only toilets but also showers, and in the morning they were both constantly busy with people taking showers for hours; it would be good to have a separate toilet in order to avoid the queue ####[['Beautiful woody accommodation in the middle of the nature, with a stunning view of the paddy rice from the second floor balcony', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The Thai food was also very good and cheap', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Surelee, the owner has to change a little bit her attitude', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['I understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Italians and having Italian dishes on the menu, we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['in my opinion she push to much the customers to purchase her trekking tour which are very expensive compared to the ones found walking by the villages', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['the 2 shared bathrooms were not only toilets but also showers, and in the morning they were both constantly busy with people taking showers for hours; it would be good to have a separate toilet in order to avoid the queue', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

273387,Incredibly comfortable bed. Great location. Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements. Preface: Their claim is "Beyond Perfection" and it is marketed as a "Luxury Boutique" 5 star hotel. While beautifully designed, many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience (function of light switches, relative position of shower and towel for maximum water coverage of said towels, maintenance work during check-out hours) and some elements already are showing wear and tear. For a 5 star hotel, the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training, with very odd formalities that were unnecessary, poorly executed, or just awkward. We also received a phone call to our room at 4:48am, which was a mistake by reception. When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves. (The manager did reimbursed us for transport when it was brought to her attention) The cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed.

The tent turned out to be really inconvenient for a windy night, could barely get any sleep as the 'walls' kept literally moving or flapping constantly. Maybe the rooms that are more cabin-like would be better...Mine didn't have a view either as shown in the pictures here. ####[['The lake view is nice', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' I stayed in the camp like room', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['The tent turned out to be really inconvenient for a windy night', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["could barely get any sleep as the 'walls' kept literally moving or flapping constantly", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["Mine didn't have a view either as shown in the pictures here", 'Branding', 'Negative']]

276145,The only good thing about the hotel was our room but I have to mention the fact that we had the Luxury Double room so we had a big room and those are located on the higher floors (we were on floor 20) so you have a nice view and the room is bright and not tooo loud. The staff on the ground floor and the reception was also very lovely. When we saw the photos of the hotel on booking we of course were amazed by the breathtaking photos of the swimming pool on the rooftop. As we knew it will be around 37 degrees in the city during our stay that was a main fact why we booked the hotel. DON’T BE BLINDED BY THOSE PHOTOS! The pool is huge and the view is nice - yess. BUT the water is disgusting. You don’t see it immediately because of the colourful mosaik floor but when you take a look closer you will see parts of old tissues and other dirt swimming in the pool. The rooftop area is huge but there are only a few possibilities (around 5-6 daybeds) to relax in the shadow and they are taken from early morning by people who are staying there all they long. THIS IS INSANE as the hotel must have hundreds of rooms!!!! When we went up there we had to sit on a bar chair at a high bar table without any shadow (not to mention that the whole exterior is old, dirty and completely uncomfortable) and we saw more and more people arriving at the rooftop just like us being disappointed by the fact that they just didn’t get any space to sit so they just left. I later found out that the rooftop area is not only exclusive for the guests but open for random guests and there is even free access from 4pm!! So the rooftop is actually a public swimming pool for 8 million people living in the city and not part of the 5star hotel you are paying for. This was so disappointing and we would never come back. As much as attentive the staff in the lobby was, less so the staff on the rooftop took any care of the fact that hotel guests were sitting on the concrete floor (there is a small concrete “island” in the centre of the pool) or cleaning dirt from people who already left…. ####[['The only good thing about the hotel was our room', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['you have a nice view', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the room is bright and not tooo loud', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the reception was also very lovely', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The pool is huge and the view is nice', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the water is disgusting', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['when you take a look closer you will see parts of old tissues and other dirt swimming in the pool', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The rooftop area is huge but there are only a few possibilities (around 5-6 daybeds) to relax in the shadow', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['THIS IS INSANE as the hotel must have hundreds of rooms', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['we had to sit on a bar chair at a high bar table without any shadow', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['the whole exterior is old, dirty and completely uncomfortable', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['more people arriving at the rooftop just like us being disappointed by the fact that they just didn’t get any space to sit so they just left', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['I later found out that the rooftop area is not only exclusive for the guests but open for random guests and there is even free access from 4pm', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['the rooftop is actually a public swimming pool for 8 million people living in the city and not part of the 5star hotel you are paying for', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['This was so disappointing and we would never come back', 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['less so the staff on the rooftop took any care of the fact that hotel guests were sitting on the concrete floor', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['cleaning dirt from people who already left', 'Service', 'Negative']]

275814,The staff was extremely helpfuly. Unfortunately, we spotted a cockroach in the hotel room in the morning after breakfast. Because it was just before check out, it wasn’t a big deal for us, but if we had spotted it the night before I would not have been able to sleep. At checkout, Jack, the receptionist asked if everything had been to our liking, we said yes, i did mention the cockroach, not to complain (i understand it is impossible to avoid cockroaches completely) but just for their awareness/prevention, and thanked them for everything. Jack went above and beyond to excuse himself for this (we said it was fine!), offered to provide us free transportation to the airport (we refused as it was fine!) and eventually offered us a monetary compensation for the inconvenience. Jack also provided us with complimentary bottles of water, which was a nice touch. Not specific to this property, but to almost all hotels/restaurants in Vietnam - the pressure to provide a good review. It just ruins the whole experience. I understand the pressure the workers go through to have good reviews (as i understand, at least for some, their salaries are dependent on these reviews), which i think is a shame. I hope employees will change this reward/salary policy soon, as it does not help the customers nor the employees. We, customers, find the service good, are happy about it, just to learn it was all for a good review that the employees all desperate to get.

The property mentioned a pool but when we got there the pool was dirty and not useable. It was incredibly hot and our kids really wanted to swim. there is not much else to do there as it’s far from the city. Be warned that there is no AC and the fans are standing fans so did not offer much relief from the oppressive heat. If you are a heat lover then this shouldn’t be an issue. i wouldn’t recommend if you have children under the age of 15. It’s a lovely spot and many people give it high reviews but for us it just wasn’t a good fit.

274432,The hostel's staff is one of the nicest and kindest I've met during my travesl. They always take interest in you and are very patient and helpful, and give the hostel a homey feeling. The rooms are spacious, nice and cosy, good smell, and the beds are super comfortable. I really liked the storage arrangment. I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that! The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom. First, it was located on the bottom floor seperated from all the rooms in the hostel. The way there is exposed with no ceiling. On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom. I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way. The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well. As it is raining quite often in Sapa I think that's a problem... also there's only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel. Another thing to mind is the location - it's about 10-15 min. climb up the hill from town. It's not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather. ####[["The hostel's staff is one of the nicest and kindest I've met during my travesl", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They always take interest in you and are very patient and helpful, and give the hostel a homey feeling', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' The rooms are spacious, nice and cosy, good smell, and the beds are super comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I really liked the storage arrangment', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['The way there is exposed with no ceiling', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [" there's only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["Another thing to mind is the location - it's about 10-15 min", 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['climb up the hill from town', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], [" It's not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather", 'Experience', 'Negative']]

The homestay is very close to the beach and has a very nice design as advertised in the pictures although a little worn down in the room itself. In my case I didn't have a window - only one to the hall way. The owner is not living at the same place so I had to wait to get instructions about the key code etc. However, that also made it very easy to check-in and out. Overall, good value for your money and would stay another time, maybe in a bigger room (that was sold out at that time) There were quite a lot of (old) spider webs in my rooms.

The stale full cigarette receptor in the foyer of our floor never seemed to be emptied. Can be a little noisy in mornings with happy children splashing and playing but tbh that was during a busy national holiday and sure beats honking and tooting! ####[['Staff friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Great location - walk or cheap ride to Old Town, easy cycle to beaches, villages and countryside', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Clean rooms, and pool area', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Pool and towels are clean', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The stale full cigarette receptor in the foyer of our floor never seemed to be emptied', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['Can be a little noisy in mornings with happy children splashing and playing ', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

276711,Great location - walking distance to Ben Tanh market, museums, Nguyen Hue street, and plenty of cafes, eateries nearby. Definitely value for money given the size of the room too. To improve on cleanliness - one of the face towels had leftover hair on it (!!!) and floor was bit sticky when I walked in/first got there. They also didn’t have an iron (not even for communal use), but offers laundry services instead. ####[['Great location', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['walking distance to Ben Tanh market, museums, Nguyen Hue street, and plenty of cafes, eateries nearby', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Definitely value for money given the size of the room', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['one of the face towels had leftover hair on it', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['floor was bit sticky when I walked in/first got there', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['They also didn’t have an iron (not even for communal use), but offers laundry services instead', 'Amenity', 'Neutral']]
