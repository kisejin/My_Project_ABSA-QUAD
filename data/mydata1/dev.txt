273791,Pool area was really nice, rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable. I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer. Staff very friendly. After ordering a sandwich the bar tender took my payment card away to reception, I presumed to bring a card machine or to swipe my card at reception. There was some misunderstanding and I thought he was asking for my room number but sometime later I got a failed chip and pin attempt notification, he had exceeded the amount of pin attempts and my card was permanently blocked! After several correspondence with my bank about how to unblock it I found out that: The card can only be unblocked in the U. K. For the rest of the trip I was unable to use my card!He probably was trying to provide extra service and be helpful, or maybe it is a cultural difference but in the U. K. no one would ever give their PIN number to someone else, especially a staff member or stranger so we would never even suspect that a member of hotel staff was asking for a PIN number and not a room number. I was annoyed to say the least and even asked them to remove the service charge. At the end they still kept the charge on and I even added somesmall tip because felt bad for the guy who made a mistake, he did also give me a complimentary cola. Though if this happened in Europe at a luxury hotel or resort the sandwich would have lest been complimented in full. Be very careful and never let anyone walk away with your card! I was also fortunate that I had another card still within free withdrawal limits for the trip. ####[['Pool area was really nice, rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' Staff very friendly', 'Service', 'Positive']]

It's right on the ocean and has got a gigantic swimming pool with a bar in it and tons of comfy mattresses and long chairs to chill, enjoy the sun and read a book. The three restaurants on site are pretty good and the breakfast definitely wins it all. That buffet is the best way to start the day. Room was very comfy, great bed, spacious, clean and with the private pool it was just the cherry on top. But what made our stay even better was the staff. The whole staff team was absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel.

When we went out in the rain we were offered umbrellas, they always hold the door open for you, complimentary drink on arrival. An excellently run hotel. We loved our stay at this hotel and would definitely rush back! nothing - best hotel we’ve stayed in!! ####[['The staff were so incredibly friendly, helped us book our onward travel at a great price, and did our washing to the best standard since travelling for a month', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Bed was comfy, bathrooms nice & spacious.

270549,One word : AMAZING. This place looks like paradise on earth. Let me tell you everything you have to know about it. 1/ Moc Home is A Big house, with a pool, and a garden in the most beautiful mountains of Vietnam . I arrived at night so I could not see the landscape but when I woke up and look throw the window I was shocked about how beautiful the place was. The house in itself is super convenient and if you go to the first floor you can have a wonderful view. There are many comfortable sits that allow you to take a nap while watching those famous rice fields. 2/ The owner, Emma, who can speak English, has been absolutely lovely with me ! She helped me in so many ways and made me feel at home which is a wonderful feeling when you are far away from your country. You can ask her to help you to plan your future destination (call a taxi, car etc….) which is super useful especially in Vietnam. 3/ Everything is super clean : the bathrooms, toilets, kitchen, rooms, beds etc so it feels like you are in a really nice hotel. 4/ The food was delicious so I recommend you to eat there from time to time (the breakfast (I have chosen pancakes) was really good and the cooker prepared the best tomato tofu of my life. ####[[' This place looks like paradise on earth', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Moc Home is A Big house, with a pool, and a garden in the most beautiful mountains of Vietnam ', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' I was shocked about how beautiful the place was', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The owner, Emma, who can speak English, has been absolutely lovely with me !

The house is simply but beautifully designed, all the facilities you need are there and nothing you do not. The small touches of the herbal foot bath and the local grown tea are excellent. I did not meet Ha as she was out doing other business but her sister Moon was excellent and helped me with everything including a late night move to the train station.

271204,The location is central, there is a supermarket nearby, nice Banh-Mi-Stands around the corner and a coffee shop closeby (E-Coffee). There were toilet amenities (soap, TP, toothbrush). The AC was working and quiet. We booked this hotel. We arrived after a long journey, and a sign was saying: we send you a message with all booking infos to self check-in. Said message never arrived. I contacted the responsible, who was quick to answer: we have issues with the climate control we have to rebook you to another location. That's how we got to Supertramp. Funny thing: it happened to another lady while we were there and she told us they rebooked her because the other one was full. This hotel looks way nicer than the other - which is why we think it's a scam. Now, reading other reviews, I realized it happened before. Coming to Supertramp:It's a construction site!At first we got offered a room with no window, which was not what we booked. They showed us another room, which we took. The room contained a kitchen and a washing-maschine (both not working) and a bed. The room was so tiny that we couldn't put our bags on the ground. Why do you put a not functioning kitchen+machine if there is no space already?!The cupboards were moist, some dirty towels were roting in them. The room was dirty. I made the mistake of looking behind the bed and in the cupboard - so much dirt, dust and spiderwebs. The walls are quite thin and not soundproof, so we heard everything (from neighbors to elevator and construction work).We wanted to pay online, but they didn't accept it: only cash. As we just arrived, we didn't have VND yet and explained that we would contact them as soon as we did and pay the bill. We stayed 3 days. Within the first day we got contacted 3 times to ask for the money (even though we previously made an agreement). In the end we got woken up by a random lady the next morning at 8a. m (she wouldn't stop knocking, spoke no English, just said "money,money". Nobody told us she would come and wake us up.

I got a head ache after 1 hour in the room which forced me to leave the window open all night and morning so slept with all of my clothes on including jackets and socks Next morning I wanted a guarantee that I could move room to one with no smell and was told they will let housekeeping double check the rooms when they become available and I could check again after midday. Unfortunately, I hated to start and waste my vacation in Hanoi this way so I left to find another hotel. Came back after a couple of hours to check out of my original 4 nights.

The owners of the hotel, a sweet pair of aunty and uncle, tried to make up for it by packing a small picnic for our Mua Cave visit.

272363,It's new and clean. Staff is mostly friendly. Good location. It had most of the amenities needed. The "breakfast" buffet was more like a light lunch. It was only some salad, dim-sums, very limited fruit (because it kept running out and the staff wasn't too eager to stock more), and water and tea. You could get an egg cooked if you asked but there's only one person making eggs and you need to wait. Normally, breakfast will have some pastries, toast and jam, more fruit, juice, etc etc. They found the cheapest kind of foods and put those out there but you still need to pay 100,000 (4. 50$USD) for it which is pretty expensive for Vietnam. Recommend DO NOT get the breakfast if you stay here. Also, for the price, you don't get much.

276287,Nice breakfast. The pool area was ok but not as good as the photo on the website. To be fair this is not my kind of hotel. This is my 8th trip to Vietnam. This is the most expensive hotel I have ever stayed in in Vietnam and the one I liked the least by a long way. My friend wanted to stay on that street and likes luxury and thought she was getting it based on photos. The hotel was very tired. My room on the 2nd floor was large and had 2 windows that I could not lock (the sliding window was too big for the space). The room was dark 24/7 as the windows looked onto a ventilation well. The bed was comfy enough and the shower hot - although it was inside the bath which I always find dangerous - there were slippery surface signs everywhere so assume there had been some disasters. There were renos at the hotel which we only found out about when we checked in - the room directly above mine was being ripped apart so there were drills, jackhammers etc from 7. 30am to 5pm everyday of our 3 night stay. My friend paid extra for a room with a view on the 8th floor - she looked straight onto a big pillar and the street below - at least she had natural light. We got our rooms at a comparatively very very cheap price during the black friday sales but both agreed we'd paid way too much. The location is nice if you are newby to HCMC and scared of crossing the street but no way is this the real Vietnam - it is cheesy tourist central. Way way better and cheaper hotels in other parts of District 1. As a note the regular guy on the egg station appeared to me to be up himself - there was a trainee guy working with him from one of the universities who was absolutely delightful and friendly who was trying very hard but was very nervous - the supervisor was a rude a..... to him - as a mum I really wanted to give him a hug and say it will get better - keep going young man you have a great personality that will take you far.

276229,- The breakfast was very good, there are several options to choose which the owner will cook for you and it will be accompanied with fresh fruit (in a generous portion). Sometimes they even surprised us with additional spring rolls or banana pancakes which were delicious.- The location is midway between the beach and the old town, which can be both reached very easily by bike in 10-15 minutes (the owner lend us the bikes for free!). It is also just beside the rice fields, so you can take a small walk and admire the beautiful landscape. There are also minimarket/restaurants/pharmacies nearby that you can reach by walking in case of need.- The best of all was of course the owner which made us feel just like home with her energy and her generosity. She also helped us to book the tours we wanted to take around Hoi An. When we come back to Hoi An (which we will do for sure!), we will definitely be staying here again. Everything was amazing, and for the price we paid we would even say it exceeded our expectations! ####[['The breakfast was very good, there are several options to choose which the owner will cook for you and it will be accompanied with fresh fruit', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Sometimes they even surprised us with additional spring rolls or banana pancakes which were delicious', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The location is midway between the beach and the old town, which can be both reached very easily by bike in 10-15 minutes', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['the owner lend us the bikes for free', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['It is also just beside the rice fields, so you can take a small walk', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['admire the beautiful landscape', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['There are also minimarket/restaurants/pharmacies nearby that you can reach by walking in case of need', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The best of all was of course the owner which made us feel just like home with her energy and her generosity', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['She also helped us to book the tours we wanted to take around Hoi An', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['When we come back to Hoi An (which we will do for sure!), we will definitely be staying here again', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['Everything was amazing', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['the price we paid we would even say it exceeded our expectations', 'Experience', 'Positive']]

270499,It really was a great hideaway and base for exploring Ben Tre. It is located on the quieter side of the river and way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel. The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area. The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more. The homestay itself is cute and homely, with a small shared living space that you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions. The rooms are located just behind a little stream at the back and provides total quietness. Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them! We stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view. Internet is great and we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us. It was such a lovely place to get away from HCMC for a few days. It is a great value for price! The only inconvenience (that can be easily rectified) is that as it is in the outskirt of Ben Tre you cannot reach there by public transport from HCMC.

276636,We really love the location of this place and we made the right decision to book. The property is located in a quiet street so you can sleep well at night. The hotel is also very convenient and accessible to food stores, grocery and attractions. The nearest attraction can only be walked less that 1 kilometer which is the St Joseph Cathedral and the farthest would be 3 kilometers. We also like the Wifi connection it’s very fast. We like the big window facing the city view. We also like the put “don’t disturb” or “clean” sign that you can show outside your door. The receptionist was accommodating and nice. The safety box was not working. So we had to always secure our valuables ourselves. There was unpleasant smell in the room. It seems like smoke from outside gets inside our room even if window is closed and especially the AC is turned on you can still smell it. I wish they could put good smell to the room. ####[['We really love the location of this place and we made the right decision to book', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The property is located in a quiet street so you can sleep well at night', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The hotel is also very convenient and accessible to food stores, grocery and attractions', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The nearest attraction can only be walked less that 1 kilometer which is the St Joseph Cathedral and the farthest would be 3 kilometers', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ['We also like the Wifi connection it’s very fast', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['We like the big window facing the city view', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['We also like the put “don’t disturb” or “clean” sign that you can show outside your door', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The receptionist was accommodating and nice', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The safety box was not working.

The decor and furnishings of the entire place were tastefully done up too, so pretty that we requested to buy some vases as souvenirs. The staffs were all very professional and polite. Food was really good too, everything we ordered was a hit. And try their signature house cocktail mix it was so good! Highly highly highly recommend to make this place your last stop in Sapa. We were a little shocked that the housekeeping team actually went into our room to clean up while we were at the dining area having our meal. It was a nice and attentive gesture but would appreciate the option for us to choose if we want the service or not, as for our personal preference, we prefer not to have housekeeping service during our stay to prevent any mishaps.

271205,Thuy and her Family are really friendly and helpful!15 minutes after I arrived her Father invited me to join him on the table with his Friends to have some happy water. It was an amazing experience, that we had again on the second night also involving all the other gasts. (No worries about the amount. We shared more than one bottle and on the next day I was feeling good - so no hangover at all!) But since you are there, and in case you are afraid of a hangover, enjoy the best coconuts you'll ever have in your life! Besides that, They provide you everything you need and also help you to plan you trip in the region. Don't miss the boat trip with her and her father!The room has its flair. I really loved the window. The location itself is really beautiful!I would highly recommend to sit there close to the River and watch the Moon rise. I was lucky to see lots of fire flies in the day of the full moon. Next time I would go for a room with AC.

273071,My family and I had a very comfortable stay at Hanoi Silk Centre hotel. The location is great. It’s in the centre of the old quarter but it’s peaceful and quiet inside. The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place. All the staff are so friendly, especially Ms Karathy and Jay. Ms Karathy booked our transfer from the airport, our trip to Ha Long Bay and was so helpful in making sure everything was sorted before we arrived. Jay made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to help us out. The day of our check out, the staff kindly allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel for the entire day until evening, when we picked up our bags to catch our overnight train to Hue. My dad accidentally left his medication in the hotel room and only realised when we got to the train station. We contacted the hotel and Jay assured us that he and the staff would find it, fortunately, they did find the medication and Jay hopped on his scooter to hand deliver the meds to us at the train station. We were so grateful that he went above and beyond and enabled us to enjoy the rest of our holiday. I hope the manager knows what fantastic staff they have, especially Ms Karathy and Jay. ####[['The location is great', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['It’s in the centre of the old quarter but it’s peaceful and quiet inside', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place', 'Positive', 'Experience'], ['My family and I had a very comfortable stay at Hanoi Silk Centre hotel', 'Branding', 'Positive'], ['All the staff are so friendly, especially Ms Karathy and Jay.

We were eventually given a room with a balcony but it had not been finished being renovated.

276951,- Very new hotel, our stay was at the very end of August 2022 and we were told the hotel has only been open for 10 days. - Trendy decorations and good ambiance. - Perfect location to explore the Old Quarter of Hanoi. - Good breakfast, we enjoyed the Pho, fresh juices and fruits especially. Restaurant staff extremely friendly. - Adding to the fact that it is new, everything is nice and clean. Every time we were coming back to the hotel after sightseeing in the city, it just felt like a breath of fresh air, since the streets of Hanoi can be very overwhelming with the traffic, the heat, the trash and vermin, our room in the spotlessly clean hotel felt like a safe haven where we can actually relax. - Staff are super attentive and always with a good attitude. Everyone is always smiling and it makes you feel very welcome. Bellmen would literally run over and open the hotel main entrance door for you when they see you approaching from the street, and they were also very sweet and ask if we would like an umbrella if it is raining or the sun is too strong. The front desk staff helped us to store our suitcases for a few hours after we came back from a 3-day Halong Bay Cruise, helped us to communicate with our Grab driver over the phone. - There were still constructions going on in the hotel (like the sky bar and spa were not yet ready during our stay). - Walls of the room are not really sound proof, you can hear people talking and walking in the corridor and the construction sounds, but this goes for most of the hotels in the Old Quarter according to our research. - The air conditioning vent is right on top of the bed and makes it quite uncomfortable for me to sleep, (my husband's side was not affected as much), we could not switch it off because it was quite hot in Hanoi when we were there, but the room is quite small (as always, it is a norm in most hotels in the Old Quarter), so there is literally no where else they can put the vent. ####[['Trendy decorations and good ambiance', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Perfect location to explore the Old Quarter of Hanoi', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Good breakfast, we enjoyed the Pho, fresh juices and fruits especially', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Restaurant staff extremely friendly', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Adding to the fact that it is new, everything is nice and clean', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['it just felt like a breath of fresh air', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['the streets of Hanoi can be very overwhelming with the traffic, the heat, the trash and vermin', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['our room in the spotlessly clean', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['hotel felt like a safe haven where we can actually relax', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['Staff are super attentive and always with a good attitude', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Everyone is always smiling and it makes you feel very welcome', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Bellmen would literally run over and open the hotel main entrance door for you when they see you approaching from the street', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['they were also very sweet and ask if we would like an umbrella if it is raining or the sun is too strong', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The front desk staff helped us to store our suitcases for a few hours after we came back from a 3-day Halong Bay Cruise, helped us to communicate with our Grab driver over the phone', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Walls of the room are not really sound proof, you can hear people talking and walking in the corridor and the construction sounds', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The air conditioning vent is right on top of the bed and makes it quite uncomfortable for me to sleep', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['the room is quite small (as always, it is a norm in most hotels in the Old Quarter)', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['this goes for most of the hotels in the Old Quarter according to our research', 'Amenity', 'Positive']]

We almost missed the bus because they were not paying attention and instead they were on their phone in their hammock. They have no sense of customer service and no values.

We spent two days comfortably cycling around the area, including Mua Cave and Trang An. Lily offers discounted prices on spa treatments.

They understood what we were looking for (discovering local culture and beautiful landscape).

It is a quiet place with a nice garden.- Rooms are convenient, with everything needed - The restaurant is nice. We had some home made pizzas but also delicious home made Vietnamese meals with the family.

The neighbourhood is very nice, with many coffee shops around, close distance to the bus that takes you directly to the airport and walking distance to the old quarter, but also to the very nice but less touristy area.

270314,The apartment is modest in size but sufficiently facilitated. There are enough amenities for either business or vacation short stay. My favorite things are probably the modern wooden interiors and the staff being quite helpful. Although there is a swimming pool in Vinhomes park, I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for some relaxing swimming time. Apart from the additional fee, entrance requires a resident's approval which was quite a hassle, we had to contact Merry House's staff and waited outside the pool for 15 minutes until they got someone to let us in. Furthermore, the pool was swarmed with local residents and the changing rooms smelt awful. ####[['There are enough amenities for either business or vacation short stay', 'Amenity', 'Neutral'], ['the modern wooden interiors', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' the staff being quite helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], [" I wouldn't recommend it", 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], ['the pool was swarmed with local residents and the changing rooms smelt awful', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The apartment is modest in size but sufficiently facilitated', 'Facility', 'Positive']]

276074,The floor and bathroom were clean and the towels were freshly washed. The manager was nice and we were able to check in 1 hour early. We were able to pay by credit card. Ac worked well Great location, very close to the bus stop to Cambodia and also main bus stand for public buses around the city. A very good Indian restaurant is in same alley as the Guest House too. It’s very safe as the main gate is always closed and only can be opened with key card. There is a small window in the room but facing another wall (but better than no window) No sound isolation and lot of guests returned to guest house around midnight to 1am so it was impossible to sleep until like 1-2am. Besides that it was calm, even though it’s just around the corner to Bu Vien Walking street. Also if the walls would be painted freshly or cleaned it would easily be a 9/10 guest house. ####[['The floor and bathroom were clean', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the towels were freshly washed', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The manager was nice', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['we were able to check in 1 hour early', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['We were able to pay by credit card', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Ac worked well', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Great location', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['very close to the bus stop to Cambodia', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['A very good Indian restaurant is in same alley as the Guest House', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['It’s very safe as the main gate is always closed', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['only can be opened with key card', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['There is a small window in the room but facing another wall (but better than no window)', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['No sound isolation', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['lot of guests returned to guest house around midnight to 1am so it was impossible to sleep until like 1-2am', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['that it was calm, even though it’s just around the corner to Bu Vien Walking street', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['if the walls would be painted freshly or cleaned it would easily be a 9/10 guest house', 'Facility', 'Negative']]
