273510,Nice looking room, spacious with a bath. Our mistake not to check but about 1. 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started. This is a really noisy place, the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning (5. 30am) people using power tools. There are rodents in the roof. The bathroom looks great but the water doesn't flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over. The bath is really nice, but the hot water only fills about 1/5 of it at a time. Not that we would have used it, as it was too cold, but the pool was empty. Staff at reception were unwelcoming, didn't provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don't speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also, so made it hard to communicate at all. An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren't asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine, but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc. let alone wanted something else. We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves. When we realised this wasn't going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out. We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left. No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty because the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were 'unlaunderable' and had to pay 180,000 dong to replace them! So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins. So, this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam and don't recommend it at all. If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access. ####[['Nice looking room, spacious with a bath', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Our mistake not to check but about 1. 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['This is a really noisy place, the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['people using power tools', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['There are rodents in the roof', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The bathroom looks grea', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["the water doesn't flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The bath is really nice', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the hot water only fills about 1/5 of it at a time', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['Not that we would have used it, as it was too cold, but the pool was empty', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["Staff at reception were unwelcoming, didn't provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don't speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also, so made it hard to communicate at all", 'Service', 'Negative'], ["An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren't asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine, but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc. let alone wanted something else", 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["When we realised this wasn't going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out", 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ['No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [" the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were 'unlaunderable' and had to pay 180,000 dong to replace them", 'Branding', 'Negative'], [' So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins', 'Experience', 'Negative'], [' this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam', 'Experience', 'Negative'], ["don't recommend it at all", 'Loyalty', 'Negative'], [' If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access', 'Amenity', 'Negative']]

Kindly, Zizi organized for a taxi to take this member back to the homestay where they could rest. The homestay accommodation was gorgeous and is actually one of the few ran by locals. The view from the room was amazing-rice field upon rice field. The beds were extremely comfortable and we were provided with mosquito nets. The food was incredible, some of the best we’ve eaten in Vietnam (so fresh). The trek itself was great too got to see a lot of ethnic minority villages and on the second day walk through a bamboo forest and to a waterfall. We felt the trek was perhaps slightly of a more advanced level than we originally thought. We (three 21 year old students) found it quite challenging at times and there was not a lot of smooth paths to walk on. We feel this is important to mention as older people or people with perhaps sustained i juried may find this difficult!

273148,The facilities of the apartment are great. Brand new building. The studio I stayed has everything I needed except the hairdryer didn’t work. The swimming pool was stunning. The organisation and communication was poor!! I requested a double bed but I had twin room. I’m the person who can’t sleep on a tiny bed. I realised that I made booking with an individual owner, not with the hotel which means any issue you have to deal directly with the owner, not the hotel staff. The staff from the owner came without notice, ring the bell and ask to pay the bill. She admitted her mistake of not providing a double bed and reduced the payment. regardless I couldn’t sleep. This room includes breakfast but be aware that it’s not hotel breakfast!!!! They take you to a local eatery for breakfast.

This time it was cancelled again during the night. They clearly didn’t want me to write a bad review and do this whenever there are complaints. I had to request a review form off booking. com support to write this. I would not trust the review score at all. This was one of the worst hotels I have stayed at in Vietnam. ####[['The room was not cleaned properly when we arrived', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['They offered an “upgrade” as compensation but this room was also dirty', 'Facility', 'Negative'], [' The buns were full of trash, hair all over the floor and bed, stains on the sheets, etc', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['After complaining again, it was clear this was the cleaning standard of the hotel so being tired from our trip we decided to just accept it', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['We spoke to staff that evening and they said it was a mistake so I booked again for the following night', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['This time it was cancelled again during the night', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['This was one of the worst hotels I have stayed at in Vietnam', 'Experience', 'Negative']]

We booked 2 rooms and both were extremely dirty and many things were broken. Furthermore, it’s stated on the internet as a 4 star hotel but it is a betray. When asking the receptionist, he said it’s 3 star and they’re renovating it to turn into 4 star in the future. This is clearly not ok since the price was like a 4 star too. When arriving, the hotelier was unfriendly and wanted to cheat us with a cheaper room without view. But that’s not what we booked. So after some discussion we received the rooms we booked but both were shockingly dirty. Fatty fingerprints everywhere, dust and dirt just like nobody cleaned the rooms for months. We originally booked for 2 nights but had to leave after 7 hours immediately to find a new hotel since it was so gross and we couldn’t sleep the whole night. After addressing these issues to the hotelier he was very rude and still wanted to charge us. It took us half a day to find a new hotel and to discuss those problems and our holidays were ruined.

274961,Firstly the staff here is superb. They were all so polite and helpful and equally attentive to everyone. I have never experienced such excellent service before. I visited Vietnam 3 years ago and did not have a pleasant experience with one of the hotel. Since then I was wary of coming back here. I am glad to say that Sun river staff changed my attitude towards Vietnam and I am so glad I came back and I now have happy memories of this country.

273624,We really enjoyed our stay. The room itself was modern, clean and had a nice view of the harbour below. In addition to this the family running the place were always on hand to help! Big shoutout to breakfast that was made to order and was delicious for two vegetarians. Only two flags with this stay is that the bathroom is a wet room which can make it pretty wet at times! The location isn't perfect. While it's a stones through away from the harbour, it is a 10 minute walk up a hill then down a hill into the town.

The room is also cleaned everyday to a high standard. The pool area is well maintained with lots of beds but never too crowded. The sun hits the pool all day and you get an incredible view of the sunset whilst you swim overlooking the rice fields. The breakfast was also great, lots of choice, freshly prepared food and super clean! Although a walk away from old town, the hotel has a free shuttle and provides free bicycles. The staff were so lovely and helpful, they got us extra pillows on request, set up the hotel computer for us and gave us a goodbye gift for our extended stay and a free airport transfer.

276956,A comfortable studio, about 10 minute stroll to the beach (or 2 minutes by bike).

The studio has a big window and balcony, the bathroom has a rain shower and the whole place feels modern and homely. The wifi connection is fast, there’s a ceiling fan to keep the air circulating as well as AC. Overall a great place, I could see it being a nice place to rent for longer stays. There is no elevator in the building, so if you have problems climbing stairs it’s not ideal as there is a pool on the ground floor so the apartments start from one flight of stairs upwards. ####[['A comfortable studio', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['about 10 minute stroll to the beach (or 2 minutes by bike)', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Xuan was friendly and helpful from the moment I arrived, she made sure the kitchen was equipped for cooking for my 5 day stay and was very communicative and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['even going so far as sending me a video instructing me on how to use the induction cooker when I was confused and providing me with a rental bike within 15 minutes of my request', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The studio has a big window and balcony', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the bathroom has a rain shower', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['the whole place feels modern and homely', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The wifi connection is fast', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['there’s a ceiling fan to keep the air circulating as well as AC', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['a great place', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['I could see it being a nice place to rent for longer stays', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['There is no elevator in the building, so if you have problems climbing stairs', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['it’s not ideal as there is a pool on the ground floor so the apartments start from one flight of stairs upwards', 'Facility', 'Neutral']]

273778,It is quite a modern hostel with all facilities. In fact it looks like a good hotel. There is plenty of space in the dorms, and in the restaurant area near reception. The beds are large and comfortable. In fact the beds are like a capsule, so once you close the curtain, there is full privacy. The bathrooms are sufficient and well equipped. They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop. I rented motorbike from here. They have really new and good quality bikes. The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house. They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat, cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike. The extra luggage can also be stored for free. They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop. The staff at the reception speaks and understands English. While the facilities are top notch, their maintenance is not upto the mark. People wear shoes in the dorms, there is nobody responsible for the lockers. There are lockers but the key is not available. I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people. They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests. The dorms are air conditioned, but since the beds are capsule type, there is no ventilation inside the cubicle. It would be nice if there was a separate fan for each cubicle. ####[['It is quite a modern hostel with all facilities', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' In fact it looks like a good hotel', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['There is plenty of space in the dorms, and in the restaurant area near reception', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The beds are large and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' the beds are like a capsule, so once you close the curtain, there is full privacy', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The bathrooms are sufficient and well equipped', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They have really new and good quality bikes', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat, cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The extra luggage can also be stored for free', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The staff at the reception speaks and understands English', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['While the facilities are top notch, their maintenance is not upto the mark', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['there is nobody responsible for the lockers', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['There are lockers but the key is not available', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests', 'Service', 'Negative'], ['The dorms are air conditioned', 'Facility', 'Positive'], [' It would be nice if there was a separate fan for each cubicle', 'Facility', 'Neutral']]

We looked forward to cinnamon tea and foot baths, as well as their home made pineapple jam and sauces every day! They also helped us with booking a motorbike tour and transfer to the airport - these services were also great with lovely staff who drove very safely. We hope to come back here again.

271229,Beautiful hotel/resort. Staff were friendly and attentive. Clean and quiet resort just by the beach. We liked our rooms 50 m walk from the beach but beds were not super comfy. Had someone above us checking in/out 3am twice in a row so that was annoying to be woken up. Other than that it was a great stay with delicious and plentiful for breakfast.

271187,Location: 300-800m near buses, Co-Op mart, and 10-15 min walk to the main beaches. Personnel: the owner/receptionist is particularly annoying. 1. there is no price list. So she could charge anything, disregarding the Booking's price. if you don't agree she would put you in a small stuffy smoking-smelling room, not as in the picture advertised. You are not allowed to remove the tray. 2. there is no cup/glass, or kettle available to discourage eating or drinking in the room. She had a set mind and tried to rule you as much as possible such as locking away all remote controls in the draw, and telling me that" no need to touch /change them". 3. When I complained about the TV not working and the water from the basin leaking on the bathroom floor, she was very argumentative, trying to put the blame on me. Instead of examining the problems or being willing to fix the issues. She was loud and aggressive and disregarded anything I said or requested persistently. She would never stop talking, once she was in my room. 4. The first day when I arrived I gave her my ID, she did not have any question. After she got to know me in he afternoon, she asked me if I have money to lend her, I laughed and left. When I got back that night I told her that I was very sick. She did not care but kept dragging on questioning my ID , trying to cause me trouble. I was very tired and sick and she would not leave me alone. When I told her that I was willing to pack my bag and leave immediately (eventhough it was almost midnight). She then shut up, and let me go to rest. The next day, the Bell boy asked me nicely if I would stay another day as booked, and tried fixing the leaking basin. So I stayed and She left me alone since. 5. Everyday, room was not cleaned nor rubbished being collected so brought them down to reception bin, she made me to throw them outside the building site. Lastly, I forgot to collect my ID after settling the account. upon realising, I called and asked her nicely to send it to my address in Saigon. ####[['300-800m near buses, Co-Op mart, and 10-15 min walk to the main beaches', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['he owner/receptionist is particularly annoying', 'Service', 'Negative'], ["there is no price list.

271338,Ideally located (10 minutes walk from Van Long nature reserve - however see negative comments below), exceptionally beautiful and well maintained grounds, excellent breakfast and the dining menu at the restaurant was very good. Rooms are more like private bungalows and were clean and comfortable. The resort, despite it's beautiful trimmings is not good value money - it's actually a greedy money grab. One particular incident left a very sour note for us. The Van Long nature reserve is literally 10 minutes walk away and the normal booking price at the ticketing office for a boatman is 70k per boat. The resort charged us over 200k per person for this "tour" for which all they did was save us the walk by dropping us with their golf cart. Their golf cart driver literally paid the ticketing office the basic fee and dropped us then came back it pick us up. So essentially we paid for the convenience of a 5 minute golf cart ride. I find this extremely greedy. A resort of this of this size should upfront be offering this information and/or even providing this drop off service for free to guests.

273490,We ended up staying at the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, so I can only comment on that. Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom. We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool. Breakfast was very good and a sensible price. if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel. Very handy little shop called Moon Milk on the street corner. A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage. The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing. We landed on a (relatively) cold and rainy evening and took the long taxi ride from Da Nang airport. The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance. We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that. There was a notice on the door saying to go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, giving the address. A sketch map would have been useful! It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel. The gentleman on reception took us up to a room, leading in and coming back out very rapidly. Obviously there was some kind of problem, and he wished to be professional about it. He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card. We were ushered to another room, which was clearly an upgrade. Whilst it lacked a couple of things (such as a toilet roll, which appeared the next day), it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom. To the credit of the manager, he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances. ####[['Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['Breakfast was very good and a sensible price', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Positive'], ['A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance', 'Amenity', 'Negative'], ['We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that', 'Service', 'Neutral'], ['A sketch map would have been useful', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The gentleman on reception took us up to a room, leading in and coming back out very rapidly', 'Service', 'Positive'], [' He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['Obviously there was some kind of problem, and he wished to be professional about it', 'Experience', 'Neutral'], ['We were ushered to another room, which was clearly an upgrade', 'Experience', 'Positive'], [' Whilst it lacked a couple of thing', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ['To the credit of the manager, he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances', 'Service', 'Negative']]

Driver spent over half an hour trying to find this hotel because incorrect name. When we finally ascertained that the White House was the hotel that we booked, driver paid the staff out asking why was it called the White House delux, staff just laughed. Staff could not speak any english. Communication was poor. Often there was no one at reception. We booked a bus through reception for nha trang and were told it was going to leave at 8. 30am. We were told we could pay with credit card on leaving. We were told in four different times that the bus would leave at 8. 30am. In the morning when we were leaving we could not have a shower because the water was cold. When we got to reception at 7. 15am we were told that the bus was leaving at 7. 40 am. Then we were told that we had to pay the hotel and bus fare in cash. After finalising the bill the staff grabbed our bags and took off from the hotel and said we had to hurry for the bus. He then disappeared into the street somewhere with our bags. We could not see him anywhere. Finally we saw him up the road dragging our bags. Eventually we got to the bus and an argument between the driver and staff because we were late.

270187,This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it's very near the Lake, the cute little streets, restaurants, night market, you name it. When you enter the hotel, you notice that the narrow entrance - which is normal for all hotels and houses in Hanoi - opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours, furniture and benches, and the most welcoming staff. Will, the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived, explained everything about the hotel and Hanoi as if he was a tour-guide, and he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits. Will is not the only gem in this hotel, as other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness, which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect. The hotel has a lift, a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby, the rooms have great beds (thank you) and a good lay-out for the space in an inner city hotel. It also has a lovely breakfast place (beautiful decoration) with good choices of food and drinks, and again great staff. However, one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the Skybar and roomservice is the best we had in Hanoi - by far. So we hope they create an inviting restaurant or rooftop eatery that creates a place for the chef to display her/his talents. Other good things to write about are the Spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff, and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place.

269976,This place only cost £13 a night for a double room so it was very cheap for Hanoi. The man behind the desk was helpful. He came up to my room when I couldn't get the air conditioning to work (there is a mains switch you need to turn on before you can use the remote control). He also booked me a taxi for the early hours the next morning to go to the airport, and it was cheaper than Grab. The location is really good, in a side street very close to the historic centre with loads of bars and restaurants on the doorstep. Towels are provided as well as toothbrush, comb, shampoo and shower gel (although it was a whitening one so I avoided). It didn't seem very clean, there were two hairs on the bed that didn't belong to me. The light fittings on the wall were very dusty and one of them didn't work. The bed was not very comfy. The air conditioning did work but the unit looked ancient and it made a lot of noise. The bathroom is in need of replacing, the tiles and taps/shower were all looking very worn/rusty. There is no lift so it is a lot of stairs to walk up with luggage. ####[['This place only cost £13 a night for a double room so it was very cheap for Hanoi', 'Experience', 'Positive'], ['The man behind the desk was helpful', 'Service', 'Positive'], ["He came up to my room when I couldn't get the air conditioning to work", 'Service', 'Positive'], ['He also booked me a taxi for the early hours the next morning to go to the airport, and it was cheaper than Grab', 'Service', 'Positive'], ['The location is really good', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['in a side street very close to the historic centre with loads of bars and restaurants on the doorstep', 'Amenity', 'Positive'], ['Towels are provided as well as toothbrush, comb, shampoo and shower gel', 'Facility', 'Positive'], ["It didn't seem very clean", 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ["there were two hairs on the bed that didn't belong to me", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ["The light fittings on the wall were very dusty and one of them didn't work", 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The bed was not very comfy', 'Facility', 'Neutral'], ['The air conditioning did work but the unit looked ancient and it made a lot of noise', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['The bathroom is in need of replacing', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['the tiles and taps/shower were all looking very worn/rusty', 'Facility', 'Negative'], ['There is no lift so it is a lot of stairs to walk up with luggage', 'Facility', 'Negative']]
