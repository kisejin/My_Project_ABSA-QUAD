274995,We stayed 3 days and 2 nights . The couple and the staff is really friendly . We asked for vegetarian dinners , which is not common , and the lady cooked several delicious things . We weren ' t pressured at all to spend more than we wanted ( on drinks or meals ) . The family room we got was comfortable and clean . The room was equipped with 2 fans working well . The view on the rice terrasses from the balcony is beautiful . You may encounter insects or spiders in the bathroom or the room but much much fewer than in another place ( HSP L ) where we slept a previous night , thanks to the construction style of the buildings . The swimming pool is really appreciated by the customers . . . But also by friends or acquaintances of the homestay family . So be prepared to get some animation ( with loud music ) on some afternoons . Like all hotels in the area , be aware that it is isolated , so you ' re a captive customer because they aren ' t real restaurants in the area and you need to be an experienced motocycler to travel around .

On one of the nights our aircon broke and the electricity went out , which isn ’ t his fault at all but he moved us to a different villa to make us comfortable when we slept . He also helped us with taxis and hiring motorbikes . His customer service is unreal . Just an all round perfect place to relax . You don ’ t even have to leave the retreat at all if you don ’ t want to . Unfortunately the electricity cut out twice when we were there . Not their fault at all . And one of the cut outs the whole street was cut out until 7 at night .

It was extremely overpriced for what you get , you have to pay for EVERYTHING , the staff are lazy and rude ( we waited over 10 minutes for our drinks at the restaurant which was nearly empty whilst 3 staff members stood around talking ! ) and not willing to take responsibility for their mistakes . On our departure , we asked the hotel to call a taxi for us and load our bags . They did not load our bags , resulting in us travelling to the bus station and then having to return to the hotel to get our missing bags . We missed our bus to our next location and had to pay for the taxi twice . When we returned back for our bags the staff were rude and unprofessional , one of the staff even gesturing to my partner and I that we were crazy .

274450,This is a cozy family home that has everything you need . Don ' t expect anything too fancy though . As a solo travel who usually stays at hostels , it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel . The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening . The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I ' ve stayed at . Bathroom was shared but was always empty . The private room also locks . Everything I could ask for ! Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market . The stairs inside the home are a little challenging . The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small ( I had to navigate them going down with my feet sideways ) . Fortunately , my room was on the first level above ground , but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you . Also , finding the apartment was a little tricky . Finding the address of the building was fine . Take the concrete stairs up a flight and go down the first hall to your right . There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it ' s easy to miss . I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end , but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn ' t confirm if I was at the right place . I left but ended up being redirected back to the apartment . The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English .

Our room had absolutely nothing to do with the pictures ! Ask them to show you the room at least before paying . It was DISGUSTING staying at this place , such an overpiced hotel !

Great location for boat rides of the caves and visiting some amazing stores in the area . Beds were very comfortable , and bikes and motor cycles helped in getting around more efficiently . The pool looked lovely but it was too cold to swim . Sam was also great in organising onwards taxi transfers . Bit too ‘ rustic ’ with long grass throughout the area , and very old / dated furniture . No ice cream , yogurt or rice available as per menu until next day . Dirt road into the property , which had many potholes . More info and explanations about the local tourist attractions would of been great in deciding priorities ( as our time was limited ) ####[['sam was very helpful and great to talk to and personable', 'service', 'positive'], ['it was lovely to hear how this is a family run business', 'experience', 'positive'], ['great location for boat rides of the caves and visiting some amazing stores in the area', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['beds were very comfortable', 'facility', 'positive'], ['bikes and motor cycles helped in getting around more efficiently', 'service', 'positive'], ['the pool looked lovely', 'facility', 'positive'], ['sam was also great in organising onwards taxi transfers', 'service', 'positive'], ['and very old / dated furniture', 'facility', 'negative'], ['bit too ‘ rustic ’ with long grass throughout the area', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['no ice cream , yogurt or rice available as per menu until next day', 'service', 'negative'], ['dirt road into the property , which had many potholes', 'facility', 'negative'], ['more info and explanations about the local tourist attractions would of been great in deciding priorities', 'experience', 'neutral']]

271187,Location : 300 - 800m near buses , Co - Op mart , and 10 - 15 min walk to the main beaches . Personnel : the owner / receptionist is particularly annoying . 1 . there is no price list . So she could charge anything , disregarding the Booking ' s price . if you don ' t agree she would put you in a small stuffy smoking - smelling room , not as in the picture advertised . You are not allowed to remove the tray . 2 . there is no cup / glass , or kettle available to discourage eating or drinking in the room . She had a set mind and tried to rule you as much as possible such as locking away all remote controls in the draw , and telling me that " no need to touch / change them " . 3 . When I complained about the TV not working and the water from the basin leaking on the bathroom floor , she was very argumentative , trying to put the blame on me . Instead of examining the problems or being willing to fix the issues . She was loud and aggressive and disregarded anything I said or requested persistently . She would never stop talking , once she was in my room . 4 . The first day when I arrived I gave her my ID , she did not have any question . After she got to know me in he afternoon , she asked me if I have money to lend her , I laughed and left . When I got back that night I told her that I was very sick . She did not care but kept dragging on questioning my ID , trying to cause me trouble . I was very tired and sick and she would not leave me alone . When I told her that I was willing to pack my bag and leave immediately ( eventhough it was almost midnight ) . She then shut up , and let me go to rest . The next day , the Bell boy asked me nicely if I would stay another day as booked , and tried fixing the leaking basin . So I stayed and She left me alone since . 5 . Everyday , room was not cleaned nor rubbished being collected so brought them down to reception bin , she made me to throw them outside the building site . Lastly , I forgot to collect my ID after settling the account . upon realising , I called and asked her nicely to send it to my address in Saigon . ####[['300 - 800m near buses , co - op mart , and 10 - 15 min walk to the main beaches', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['he owner / receptionist is particularly annoying', 'service', 'negative'], ["there is no price list . so she could charge anything , disregarding the booking ' s price", 'service', 'negative'], ["if you don ' t agree she would put you in a small stuffy smoking - smelling room", 'service', 'negative'], ['not as in the picture advertised', 'branding', 'negative'], ['you are not allowed to remove the tray', 'service', 'negative'], ['there is no cup / glass , or kettle available to discourage eating or drinking in the room', 'facility', 'negative'], ['she had a set mind and tried to rule you as much as possible such as locking away all remote controls in the draw , and telling me that " no need to touch / change them', 'service', 'negative'], ['when i complained about the tv not working and the water from the basin leaking on the bathroom floor , she was very argumentative , trying to put the blame on me', 'service', 'negative'], ['she was loud and aggressive and disregarded anything i said or requested persistently . she would never stop talking , once she was in my room', 'service', 'negative'], ['after she got to know me in he afternoon , she asked me if i have money to lend her', 'service', 'negative'], ['she did not care but kept dragging on questioning my id , trying to cause me trouble', 'service', 'negative'], ['everyday , room was not cleaned nor rubbished being collected so brought them down to reception bin , she made me to throw them outside the building site', 'service', 'negative']]

270499,It really was a great hideaway and base for exploring Ben Tre . It is located on the quieter side of the river and way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel . The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area . The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more . The homestay itself is cute and homely , with a small shared living space that you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions . The rooms are located just behind a little stream at the back and provides total quietness . Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them ! We stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view . Internet is great and we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us . It was such a lovely place to get away from HCMC for a few days . It is a great value for price ! The only inconvenience ( that can be easily rectified ) is that as it is in the outskirt of Ben Tre you cannot reach there by public transport from HCMC . The small taxi rides are absolutely worth being in the quietness and lush green surroundings ! ####[['it is located on the quieter side of the river', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the homestay itself is cute and homely , with a small shared living space', 'facility', 'positive'], ['you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions', 'service', 'positive'], ['each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them ! we stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view', 'facility', 'positive'], ['internet is great', 'facility', 'positive'], ['we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us', 'service', 'positive'], ['it was such a lovely place to get away from hcmc for a few days', 'experience', 'positive'], ['it is a great value for price', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the only inconvenience ( that can be easily rectified ) is that as it is in the outskirt of ben tre you cannot reach there by public transport from hcmc', 'amenity', 'negative']]

The room also had a moderately sized balcony facing the street too ! The owner made sure we knew if we wanted the rooms cleaned or more towels / toilet roll we should ask her and the location was close to the old town with cafes , convenience stores and ATMS all within walking distance .

The decor and furnishings of the entire place were tastefully done up too , so pretty that we requested to buy some vases as souvenirs . The staffs were all very professional and polite . Food was really good too , everything we ordered was a hit . And try their signature house cocktail mix it was so good ! Highly highly highly recommend to make this place your last stop in Sapa . We were a little shocked that the housekeeping team actually went into our room to clean up while we were at the dining area having our meal . It was a nice and attentive gesture but would appreciate the option for us to choose if we want the service or not , as for our personal preference , we prefer not to have housekeeping service during our stay to prevent any mishaps .

274491,Beautiful open see through lobby , lovely ocean view rooms with a balcony , superb breakfast buffet , wonderful staff and service , and a playroom for the kids with an attendant . The location is perfect , in the city but quieter when compared to the main road area . We ate at the restaurant several times , the seafood buffet was good , a la carte was really good too . The spa was lovely . We were very happy with our stay at Furama . It was great overall , we were very happy with our stay , difficult to find anything wrong . To note , for a family of 2 adults + 2 children , it would make sense to book an ocean view suite rather than take a garden view room . This is because when they say 2 twin beds , it means 2 single beds in the garden room which aren ' t useful for 2 adults and 2 kids . So you have to take an extra bed at an added cost . Hence for a similar price , take the ocean view room which come with 2 platform sofa ' s which can convert to 2 kids beds and a fantastic view ! Mr .

276287,Nice breakfast . The pool area was ok but not as good as the photo on the website . To be fair this is not my kind of hotel . This is my 8th trip to Vietnam . This is the most expensive hotel I have ever stayed in in Vietnam and the one I liked the least by a long way . My friend wanted to stay on that street and likes luxury and thought she was getting it based on photos . The hotel was very tired . My room on the 2nd floor was large and had 2 windows that I could not lock ( the sliding window was too big for the space ) . The room was dark 24 / 7 as the windows looked onto a ventilation well . The bed was comfy enough and the shower hot - although it was inside the bath which I always find dangerous - there were slippery surface signs everywhere so assume there had been some disasters . There were renos at the hotel which we only found out about when we checked in - the room directly above mine was being ripped apart so there were drills , jackhammers etc from 7 . 30am to 5pm everyday of our 3 night stay . My friend paid extra for a room with a view on the 8th floor - she looked straight onto a big pillar and the street below - at least she had natural light . We got our rooms at a comparatively very very cheap price during the black friday sales but both agreed we ' d paid way too much . The location is nice if you are newby to HCMC and scared of crossing the street but no way is this the real Vietnam - it is cheesy tourist central . Way way better and cheaper hotels in other parts of District 1 . As a note the regular guy on the egg station appeared to me to be up himself - there was a trainee guy working with him from one of the universities who was absolutely delightful and friendly who was trying very hard but was very nervous - the supervisor was a rude a . . . . . to him - as a mum I really wanted to give him a hug and say it will get better - keep going young man you have a great personality that will take you far .

I saw some comments about the breakfast being limited - it is a small selection but is delicious and had some wonderful local classics and coffee , so did not mind it at all . There is also a lovely pool at the roof and small gym , did not use but looks great . Highly recommended and will definitely go back . Wonderful to go back to the calm , cool oasis after a crazy day out in the city1 Nothing ! If anything , it was a noisy area , mostly from music from bars and some events in the area , but that isn ' t really the hotel ' s fault . They were kind enough to give earplugs . ####[['amazing hotel', 'branding', 'positive'], ['right in the center of hcm city', 'experience', 'positive'], ['perfect for a stay to visit and explore the city', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the building is a beautifully designed oasis in the middle of the chaos of the city', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the rooms and common areas are beautiful , the lobby lounge is a lovely cozy area to chill with a cup of coffee or tea', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the breakfast being limited - it is a small selection', 'service', 'negative'], ['but is delicious and had some wonderful local classics and coffee', 'service', 'positive'], ['there is also a lovely pool at the roof and small gym', 'facility', 'positive'], ['highly recommended and will definitely go back', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['it was a noisy area , mostly from music from bars and some events in the area', 'experience', 'negative'], ['they were kind enough to give earplugs', 'facility', 'positive'], ['wonderful to go back to the calm , cool oasis after a crazy day out in the city', 'experience', 'positive']]

We like the big window facing the city view . We also like the put “ don ’ t disturb ” or “ clean ” sign that you can show outside your door . The receptionist was accommodating and nice . The safety box was not working . So we had to always secure our valuables ourselves . There was unpleasant smell in the room .

Our recommendation what you should see : Da Nang bridges , Lady Buddha , Marmor mountains , and of course Ba na hils - for our opinion the Golden bridge is too advertised , but everything else is just fantastic - castles on top of the mountain , Buddhist temples and statues , pagodas , various gardens - just amazing !!! , attractions ( everything is included in the ticket price ) - this will definitely not leave you indifferent .

The staff are on hand 24 / 7 to help out and even have a Whats App if you need their assistance whilst out etc . If you need anything the staff are happy to help . Ms . Kim was super helpful and gave us so many recommendations on local cuisine , activities and shows and also assisted in booking us tickets .

274511,The room was comfortable and clean , and the pool was very nice ( apart from the rubbish at the bottom ) . It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi ’ s are available to get into town . The cleaning staff were very friendly . The staff weren ’ t helpful - there is a clear lack of management . The pool bar wait times are ridiculous , 1 . 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water , 1 . 5 for food as well . On our first 2 days the wait wasn ’ t as bad but there was only one person , the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long . The food and drink is also very overpriced ( western prices ) and very average . The laundry service is ridiculously expensive , we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear ! There is no local advice available from the staff . We weren ’ t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren ’ t offered the welcome drink they advertise .

They understood what we were looking for ( discovering local culture and beautiful landscape ) .

It is a quiet place with a nice garden . - Rooms are convenient , with everything needed - The restaurant is nice .

270187,This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it ' s very near the Lake , the cute little streets , restaurants , night market , you name it . When you enter the hotel , you notice that the narrow entrance - which is normal for all hotels and houses in Hanoi - opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours , furniture and benches , and the most welcoming staff . Will , the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived , explained everything about the hotel and Hanoi as if he was a tour - guide , and he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits . Will is not the only gem in this hotel , as other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness , which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect . The hotel has a lift , a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby , the rooms have great beds ( thank you ) and a good lay - out for the space in an inner city hotel . It also has a lovely breakfast place ( beautiful decoration ) with good choices of food and drinks , and again great staff . However , one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the Skybar and roomservice is the best we had in Hanoi - by far . So we hope they create an inviting restaurant or rooftop eatery that creates a place for the chef to display her / his talents . Other good things to write about are the Spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff , and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place . Vietnam is colourful , and this is reflected in the interior design . We saw tourists stay here , as well as business people and locals , so we felt right at home . The hotel could possibly offer water refill - locations so less plastic is used , but it seems that Vietnam should tackle that problem in more hotels and locations . ####[["this hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting hanoi as it ' s very near the lake", 'amenity', 'positive'], ['opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours , furniture and benches', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the hotel has a lift , a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby , the rooms have great beds ( thank you ) and a good lay - out for the space in an inner city hotel', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it also has a lovely breakfast place ( beautiful decoration ) with good choices of food and drinks', 'service', 'positive'], ['great staff', 'service', 'positive'], ['one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the skybar and roomservice is the best we had in hanoi', 'service', 'positive'], ['other good things to write about are the spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff , and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place', 'service', 'positive'], ['vietnam is colourful , and this is reflected in the interior design', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the most welcoming staff . will , the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived , explained everything about the hotel and hanoi as if he was a tour - guide', 'service', 'positive'], ['he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits', 'service', 'positive'], ['other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness , which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect', 'service', 'positive']]

One particular incident left a very sour note for us . The Van Long nature reserve is literally 10 minutes walk away and the normal booking price at the ticketing office for a boatman is 70k per boat . The resort charged us over 200k per person for this " tour " for which all they did was save us the walk by dropping us with their golf cart . Their golf cart driver literally paid the ticketing office the basic fee and dropped us then came back it pick us up . So essentially we paid for the convenience of a 5 minute golf cart ride .

Not only was the room lovely , huge , convenient and comfy , but the fridge was stocked with drinks , there were free toothbrushes , shampoo , shower gel , hairdryer , tv , water cooker and a balcony attached . Besides the room , the real gem of this place is the people . The family running this homestay is so helpful in arranging trips , explaining the ins and outs of Hoi An and would even go so far as to lend me money when my card wasnˋt working for a day .

274240,Staying at Hmong Sister House was a truly memorable experience . From the moment I arrived , I was struck by the warm and friendly atmosphere of the homestay . Lily , the hostess , was incredibly welcoming and made sure that I felt right at home . The homestay itself is a beautifully designed wooden house , filled with traditional Hmong crafts and artifacts . The surrounding natural landscape is breathtakingly beautiful , with rolling hills and lush forests stretching out in every direction . Even though the weather was a bit chilly during my stay , the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the house made me feel comfortable and relaxed . I loved the chance to learn more about Hmong culture and traditions during my stay , and appreciated Lily ' s insights and stories about her own experiences . Overall , I would highly recommend Hmong Sister House to anyone looking for a unique and authentic travel experience , and I can ' t wait to come back and visit again in the future . ####[['staying at hmong sister house was a truly memorable experience', 'experience', 'positive'], ['from the moment i arrived , i was struck by the warm and friendly atmosphere of the homestay', 'experience', 'positive'], ['lily , the hostess , was incredibly welcoming and made sure that i felt right at home', 'service', 'positive'], ['the homestay itself is a beautifully designed wooden house , filled with traditional hmong crafts and artifacts', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the surrounding natural landscape is breathtakingly beautiful , with rolling hills and lush forests stretching out in every direction', 'experience', 'positive'], ['even though the weather was a bit chilly during my stay , the cozy and inviting atmosphere of the house made me feel comfortable and relaxed', 'experience', 'positive'], ["i loved the chance to learn more about hmong culture and traditions during my stay , and appreciated lily ' s insights and stories about her own experiences", 'experience', 'positive'], ['i would highly recommend hmong sister house to anyone looking for a unique and authentic travel experience', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ["i can ' t wait to come back and visit again in the future", 'loyalty', 'positive']]

271206,Babylon Premium Hotel , lead by a committed workforce , is a wonderful establishment in the bustling old quarter of Hanoi . I had the pleasure of staying here during my birthday and the events that followed after I arrived would absolutely motivate me to stay here again . After a day of sightseeing , I returned to my room to be greeted with birthday decorations , a birthday cake and 3 key members of staff ( including the manager ) wishing me a happy birthday . Additionally , the next day , a family was celebrating their daughters birthday during breakfast and the hotel made a similar effort by giving her a birthday cake too . Such actions really do show that the hotel staff care about their guests and will happily go out of their way to make their holiday memorable .

At checkout , Jack , the receptionist asked if everything had been to our liking , we said yes , i did mention the cockroach , not to complain ( i understand it is impossible to avoid cockroaches completely ) but just for their awareness / prevention , and thanked them for everything . Jack went above and beyond to excuse himself for this ( we said it was fine ! ) , offered to provide us free transportation to the airport ( we refused as it was fine ! ) and eventually offered us a monetary compensation for the inconvenience . Jack also provided us with complimentary bottles of water , which was a nice touch . Not specific to this property , but to almost all hotels / restaurants in Vietnam - the pressure to provide a good review . It just ruins the whole experience . I understand the pressure the workers go through to have good reviews ( as i understand , at least for some , their salaries are dependent on these reviews ) , which i think is a shame . I hope employees will change this reward / salary policy soon , as it does not help the customers nor the employees . We , customers , find the service good , are happy about it , just to learn it was all for a good review that the employees all desperate to get .

He then disappeared into the street somewhere with our bags . We could not see him anywhere . Finally we saw him up the road dragging our bags . Eventually we got to the bus and an argument between the driver and staff because we were late .

273778,It is quite a modern hostel with all facilities . In fact it looks like a good hotel . There is plenty of space in the dorms , and in the restaurant area near reception . The beds are large and comfortable . In fact the beds are like a capsule , so once you close the curtain , there is full privacy . The bathrooms are sufficient and well equipped . They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop . I rented motorbike from here . They have really new and good quality bikes . The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house . They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat , cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike . The extra luggage can also be stored for free . They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop . The staff at the reception speaks and understands English . While the facilities are top notch , their maintenance is not upto the mark . People wear shoes in the dorms , there is nobody responsible for the lockers . There are lockers but the key is not available . I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people . They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests . The dorms are air conditioned , but since the beds are capsule type , there is no ventilation inside the cubicle . It would be nice if there was a separate fan for each cubicle . ####[['it is quite a modern hostel with all facilities', 'facility', 'positive'], ['in fact it looks like a good hotel', 'facility', 'positive'], ['there is plenty of space in the dorms , and in the restaurant area near reception', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the beds are large and comfortable', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the beds are like a capsule , so once you close the curtain , there is full privacy', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the bathrooms are sufficient and well equipped', 'facility', 'positive'], ['they provide motorbike rental and tour services for hà giang loop', 'service', 'positive'], ['they have really new and good quality bikes', 'service', 'positive'], ['the bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house', 'service', 'positive'], ['they also provided all basic necessities like raincoat , cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike', 'service', 'positive'], ['the extra luggage can also be stored for free', 'service', 'positive'], ['they also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop', 'service', 'positive'], ['the staff at the reception speaks and understands english', 'service', 'positive'], ['while the facilities are top notch , their maintenance is not upto the mark', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['there is nobody responsible for the lockers', 'amenity', 'negative'], ['there are lockers but the key is not available', 'amenity', 'negative'], ['i think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people', 'service', 'negative'], ['they seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests', 'service', 'negative'], ['the dorms are air conditioned', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it would be nice if there was a separate fan for each cubicle', 'facility', 'neutral']]

There was a lift up to the 5th floor which was a bonus especially for an older couple . the staff were very helpful in all of our queries and they went out of their way to help . The price is the selling point of the hotel . The view from the balcony was outstanding . We had booked a room with a balcony , but there was a discrepancy between what we had on booking . com and what they received . We were eventually given a room with a balcony but it had not been finished being renovated .

273490,We ended up staying at the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead , so I can only comment on that . Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom . We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool . Breakfast was very good and a sensible price . if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel . Very handy little shop called Moon Milk on the street corner . A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage . The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing . We landed on a ( relatively ) cold and rainy evening and took the long taxi ride from Da Nang airport . The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance . We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that . There was a notice on the door saying to go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead , giving the address . A sketch map would have been useful ! It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel . The gentleman on reception took us up to a room , leading in and coming back out very rapidly . Obviously there was some kind of problem , and he wished to be professional about it . He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card . We were ushered to another room , which was clearly an upgrade . Whilst it lacked a couple of things ( such as a toilet roll , which appeared the next day ) , it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom .

274345,The boat itself is absolutely beautiful . The rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay . It feels magical . The staff were extremely kind and welcoming . We did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized . Kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in Vietnam . All the food was quite good and was included . But , FYI if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise . The staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood . The baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window , so you can look out at the bay , which is great . This ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay . The balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures . No drinks are included and although they have a buy 2 get 1 free happy hour , the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying it would be nice if they were included . On the last day as well we went on the tour to the caves on the bamboo boats , which was great to see . However , there was very little time after the tour before checkout to shower or pack and it felt quite rushed . ####[['the boat itself is absolutely beautiful', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it feels magical', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the staff were extremely kind and welcoming', 'service', 'positive'], ['we did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized', 'service', 'positive'], ['kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in vietnam', 'experience', 'positive'], ['all the food was quite good and was included', 'service', 'positive'], ['if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['the staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood', 'service', 'positive'], ['the baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window', 'facility', 'positive'], ['you can look out at the bay , which is great', 'experience', 'positive'], ['this ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay', 'branding', 'positive'], ['the balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures', 'facility', 'negative'], ['no drinks are included', 'service', 'negative'], ['the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying', 'service', 'negative'], ['it would be nice if they were included', 'service', 'neutral'], ['on the last day as well we went on the tour to the caves on the bamboo boats , which was great to see .', 'experience', 'positive'], ['there was very little time after the tour before checkout to shower or pack and it felt quite rushed', 'experience', 'negative']]

I finally arrived late in the evening after consuming as much of the wonder that is Hue . I came back to what was supreme quiet and excellent accommodation as I prepared myself some food and go the comfort and quiet of a evening left to my own devices .

The staff strive for excellence and deliver . We are very lucky coming from a wealthy country to be able to afford a hotel in this category and pay the rate it asks , something not so available to most Vietnamese . In their pursuit of excellence i felt the staff were required to show a sense of deference . I felt slightly uncomfortable when they rushed to open the hotel door if they hadnt noticed me coming in or out , i felt slightly uncomfortable being referred to as ' Sir ' all the time - - I prefer more a more casual , , relaxed service from staff . I am not a superior being , i ' m no better than the staff that work here , but i felt like i was treated as one - Management want excellence and thats the standard they expect delivered . . I ' m just not a big fan of it . I prefer a more casual , relaxed , service . I want to see the staffs personality , humour , warmth , relaxed conviviality , not just their trained efficiency . - - Yep , maybe it ' s just me .

271433,Good location around 5 minutes from the beach . The rooftop pool had a good view across the city .

We had a large family who used the hallway and lift as a playground , with the children screaming and crying while the parents shouted up and down the hallway from 5 . 30am until midnight each day . We told reception who didn ' t care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy . There are alarms on the hotel bedroom doors as they are awkward to close , the alarms are good for safety however the other rooms would leave their doors open with the alarms beeping from early until late which again kept us awake . The hotel is not 4 * , more 2 or 3 * , it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating . The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily . The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up . We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym , just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment , no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill .

270419,It is run and built by the family , the bungalows are just beautiful and make you feel free , not to mention the fantastic view of the rice fields . They welcomed me very well and helped me with transportation , there are not many alternatives besides a few local cabs . The food was fantastic and plentiful . As for communication I used to write directly to the guy in whatsapp in English and it worked very well . If you are a nature lover , you can ' t miss this stage . I had a hard time figuring out how to get there , better to contact the facility in advance and ask for directions . Pu Luong as far as tourism is concerned is not yet developed e . g . with already organized tours , you have to plan well for travel within and figure out what you want to see maybe ask the family for advice in advance . Even to move later in Ninh Binh I could not find any bus but had to take a cab . ####[['the bungalows are just beautiful and make you feel free , not to mention the fantastic view of the rice fields', 'facility', 'positive'], ['they welcomed me very well and helped me with transportation', 'service', 'positive'], ['the food was fantastic and plentiful', 'service', 'positive']]

The bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet , there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed , the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area .

274401,This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach . The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach , but since the beach wasn ' t very busy , you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across . The resort itself is extensive but it doesn ' t feel too large ; it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends , so these times are busy . The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps . There are plenty of beds around that pool and you can have drinks there . The restaurant is good , so spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option . The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration . On the whole , the design of the place is amazing , with plenty of Koi carp ponds , wooden carving , well - maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms . The staffs were amazing and it ' s really nice to talk to them ( thank you Ann !) . What has been the best for us was the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil , a nice pool , the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well ( Covid had closed that down ) . It ' s worth it staying there for a week or more if you ' re looking for a relaxing pool / beach holiday , but for food you have to either use their restaurant , or use a few local restaurants nearby - or go into town , of course ( which you have to as Hoi An is an amazing , but touristy , town !) It ' s not so much what we didn ' t like , but maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well . Also , the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient , but the last one back from town is at 17 . 30 , so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back , which is a bit of a hassle when it gets busy . ####[['this resort is set a short walking distance to the beach', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the design of the place is amazing , with plenty of koi carp ponds , wooden carving , well - maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms', 'facility', 'positive'], ["the staffs were amazing and it ' s really nice to talk to them", 'service', 'positive'], ['the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil , a nice pool , the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well', 'facility', 'positive'], ["it ' s worth it staying there for a week or more if you ' re looking for a relaxing pool / beach holiday", 'experience', 'positive'], ['maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well', 'service', 'neutral'], ['the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient , but the last one back from town is at 17 . 30 , so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['the resort itself is extensive', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of koi carps', 'facility', 'positive'], ['there are plenty of beds around that pool', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the restaurant is good', 'service', 'positive'], ['spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option', 'experience', 'positive'], ['you can have drinks there', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['the rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the resort has a small private part reserved on that beach', 'facility', 'positive'], ["the beach wasn ' t very busy , you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across", 'experience', 'positive'], ['it is used by the vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends , so these times are busy', 'experience', 'neutral']]

276066,We had a great stay at Bare Han during our four nights in Da Nang . I believe they have four rooms at the property , three of them in one building , and a fourth right next door ( the Ground Floor Room ) . We stayed in the Ground Floor Room , which may have some differences from the other three . We were very happy with the room . It is spacious , the bed is comfortable , and the bedside tables provide a lot of tabletop space to place things - and two electrical outlets above each one for charging devices . The shower has some of the best water pressure we have seen around Southeast Asia , and very stable temperature control . The shower includes a nice rain shower head as well as a handheld . There is a small desk space with two outlets and a decent chair for using a laptop , and there is also a small table with two chairs for dining or drinking coffee . The internet was good enough that I could play a fairly bandwidth - heavy computer game without any glitches during one afternoon . It is easy to get to this place by simply asking your driver to take you to the Da Nang Cathedral . The address provided by the property also worked with our airport taxi , who dropped us at the cathedral . Immediately across the street from the cathedral is an alley with a red banner over it that leads to the building . This alley also has a dessert shop ( Mlem Pudding ) right across from the Bare Han building , and a coffee shop . The location is excellent , with a convenience store just down the block from the alley entrance , and several Pho and Banh Mi vendors and restaurants just around the corner to the left . There are several coffee shops in the area . We recommend An Le Cafe if you don ' t mind sitting outdoors with a fan ( “ Anle Cafe ” on Google Maps ) . If you want air conditioning , Traditional Coffee is around the corner and at the end of the next block . If you need to do laundry while you are here , we took ours to “ Co So Giat Uit Hap Minh Trang ” at 76 Tran Quoc Toan . This particular room only had two drawbacks , that were not really a problem for us . The first is that the windows at the end of the room look out onto the blank wall of another building , that is less than a meter away . They have put plants in the space , as well as lights , which is a nice solution , but there is very little natural light and you cannot tell how the weather is without opening the front door . The room itself has plenty of artificial light , though . I believe the other three rooms in the main building have windows that look out toward the more spacious alley , but I ' m not sure . The only other negative is that the toilet and shower have glass doors . You can draw some curtains around the area outside these two stalls for more privacy , but they are not fully opaque . The toilet and shower stalls themselves also have shades that can be drawn down , and these provide full privacy while in the stalls . ####[['we had a great stay at bare han during our four nights in da nang', 'experience', 'positive'], ['we were very happy with the room', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it is spacious', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the bed is comfortable', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the bedside tables provide a lot of tabletop space to place things', 'facility', 'positive'], ['two electrical outlets above each one for charging devices', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the shower has some of the best water pressure we have seen around southeast asia', 'facility', 'positive'], ['stable temperature control', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the shower includes a nice rain shower head as well as a handheld', 'facility', 'positive'], ['there is a small desk space with two outlets and a decent chair for using a laptop', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the internet was good enough', 'facility', 'positive'], ['i could play a fairly bandwidth - heavy computer game without any glitches during one afternoon', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the location is excellent', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['a convenience store just down the block from the alley entrance , and several pho and banh mi vendors and restaurants just around the corner to the left', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['there are several coffee shops in the area', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the windows at the end of the room look out onto the blank wall of another building , that is less than a meter away', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the toilet and shower have glass doors', 'facility', 'negative'], ['they are not fully opaque', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the toilet and shower stalls themselves also have shades that can be drawn down , and these provide full privacy while in the stalls', 'facility', 'positive']]

273915,We had 2 rooms with street view . The rooms were a bit musty but once the aircon kicked in it wasn ' t too bad . Beds are hard and water flows out from shower to toilet room . There is a lift to ground floor but you then need to go down another 2 set of stairs to get to the pool . Not good for people in wheelchairs or with mobility issues . I ended up having to go outside and walk down driveway to get to pool . Repeatedly asked to get mini fridge replaced in one room but they had no idea . Kept saying yes and everyday it still didn ' t work . Gave up after 3 days . The breakfast was quite good . Had a variety of food for buffet and even on the day they did a la carte there was a good choice . Only a 10 min walk to night market . The pool looked nice and the kids enjoyed it . They do supply a towel for swimming . They need more people that can understand English at the front desk . Not sure I would use it again but it was fairly cheap . The ground floor was in construction and nothing down there , just empty rooms . Reception was on 1st floor .

There were many problems with the room . Firstly there are no external windows , only a window into the corridor . This was constantly lit through poor curtains meaning the room was never dark . There was no separation between the bar / music and our room , I could make out conversations whilst trying to sleep . The pool plant room was just outside the ‘ window ’ , this was quite noisy .

Apart from the western menu , rest of the food was exceptional . This is the one of the beautiful resort , I have stayed . Usually we are going to the beachside , not countryside . Therefore , I really enjoyed the view and the climate . The quality of the Western food that served in the resort was not that good . Foe example , we had BBQ Pork Ribs which were really hard to cut the meat and not that taste . Usually this is not the case . Also , the reception staff is lack of communication .

We were upgraded to the top floor but the room was not clean e . g . candy wrappers from previous guest , mirror is not clean and the bathroom has molds . We asked to be transfered to another room and they did . The next room was okay but I woke up in the middle of the night smelling molds again . I hope they will make some updates of the building . Second , the breakfast is okay but a bit limited . Lastly , we felt that the ladies at the reception are intrusive . For example , the moment we arrived , we just want a rest as we were tired but she was selling us many many things like tours or tailors and repeat many unnecessary information which was annoying for us . They keep asking questions like who is your taxi driver , where are you going , which store ? . . I mean , I understand they get some kind of commision but please we are on our holiday and we decide where to buy stuff . On our last day , the lady tried to convinced us to stay one more night in their hotel and beg to give them 10 review which didnt sit well on us .

Mr Danh is very friendly and an excellent host - he also speaks good English so communication was no problem . Mr Danh actually lives in the community , so he provided great guide to the local eateries and roads which was useful for us .

274389,The place is exactly as expected from the pictures and reviews . The owner helped us upgrade one twin room to a family room , and it was very spacious . She also helped arrange bikes and motorbikes for us to borrow to travel to the city center and helped troubleshoot problems when needed . Overall , we were very impressed with the hospitality . We arrived by car from Da Nang and had some trouble navigating since the alley to this place was very narrow , but there was some parking space in front of the villa itself so it wasn ' t a problem . You will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away ( free bikes , motorbikes , car - bit difficult considering the alley , or taxis and other options ) . Some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim - to fit the vibe . I wouldn ' t recommend this place for those with small children because the pool facilities and general structure of the place are not very child - friendly . ####[['the place is exactly as expected from the pictures and reviews', 'branding', 'positive'], ['the owner helped us upgrade one twin room to a family room', 'service', 'positive'], ['it was very spacious', 'facility', 'positive'], ['she also helped arrange bikes and motorbikes for us to borrow to travel to the city center and helped troubleshoot problems when needed', 'service', 'positive'], ['overall , we were very impressed with the hospitality', 'experience', 'positive'], ['there was some parking space in front of the villa itself', 'facility', 'positive'], ['you will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away', 'amenity', 'neutral'], ['some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim', 'facility', 'negative'], ["i wouldn ' t recommend this place for those with small children", 'loyalty', 'negative'], ['the pool facilities and general structure of the place are not very child - friendly', 'facility', 'negative']]

Then I want to go to the pool , so I leave my room - but oh the keyroom reader on my door doesn ’ t work - turns out battery ran out ! So I go to the lobby and ask the lobby guy to fix it . He promises to come back in a moment to do so , so I wait for him in my room . Doesnt show up . Had to go ask for it AGAIN the next day for this guy to do his work ( of course no one at the reception figured that it would perhaps be a good idea to call me and let me know he wont show up using the room phone next to bed ) And then to top it off , its about 3 : 10 am in the middle of the night and now the hotel room telephone built in next to my bed rings . I pick it up . Nothing . Well , thanks for giving me a call in the middle of the night smart person at the reception So yeah it wasnt a good stay .

Surfaces in the room were somewhat worn out , and there was some visible water damage in the bathroom , tiles were cracked etc . You could hear all the noises from the hallway . The walls / windows were so thin , that it felt like the windows were open because the traffic noises were so loud , and it was a little hard to sleep . Update / / They asked us to do a written review about the hotel upon check out . We wrote same things on that and here in the booking review . Mostly great things about the service and staff , only complaints was the noises and the fact that the room might need some updates / renovations . We waited in the hotel lobby for a car to pick us up to the airport , and the manager came to us apologizing and they gave us a 50 % refund from the car service . We thought that was unnessecary , but it felt nice that they reacted to our feedback . I also wrote this booking review waiting in the lobby , usually I wait to get out of the hotel to do that , I should ’ ve done it now too . The manager had seen my booking review and came back to talk to us , asking us to change the review from 8 to 10 . We felt super uncomfortable that he asked us to do so . We just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible . For that point we had nothing but great things to say about the staff , but now it left us with a bad taste to our mouths , and this wasn ’ t a great ending to our 2 - week trip to Vietnam , which had been nothing but lovely so far .
