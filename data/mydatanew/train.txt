274373,The property is converted from an old government office building to homestay . Its design is based on the concept of local ethnic groups in Sapa . You could see the owner put a lot of efforts on the design and materials used . Many recycled and traditional local ethnic group materials are used in the homestay . The staff were super helpful and friendly during my stay . They recommended some cafes with awesome view and try their best to fulfill my request . This homestay serve vegan food for lunch and dinner . I tried their local Vietnamese style began food and it was delicious . The chef has many years of working experience in hospitality line . She worked in 5 - stars resorts in South East Asia and Middle East . As it was low season due to covid - 19 , the owner took extra mile by offering me a personal trip from Sapa to Y Ty when i asked him for tour package . It was a wonderful experience although the journey was not easy for me . In short , the price / night is considered under value ( properly due to low season and covid - 19 ) in view of the level of services provided by them .

271170,This is the first bad review i ’ ve ever written so far . We booked this hotel because they should offer a buffet breakfast and they should also have a gym . But non of them was provided . There is also almost no breakfast possibilities in the sourroundings exept pho or seafood . We booked a deluxe room in a ( apparently ) 4 star hotel , but the room we more like a good budget doubleroom . The queensize bed was cozy , but iz was not one double bed but 2 single beds next to each other . The room was only cleaned once during the stay of 4 days . So in conclusion we would not recommend this hotel if you expect a little bit more comfort . ####[['we booked this hotel because they should offer a buffet breakfast and they should also have a gym . but non of them was provided', 'branding', 'negative'], ['there is also almost no breakfast possibilities in the sourroundings exept pho or seafood', 'service', 'negative'], ['we booked a deluxe room in a ( apparently ) 4 star hotel , but the room we more like a good budget doubleroom', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the queensize bed was cozy , but iz was not one double bed but 2 single beds next to each other', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the room was only cleaned once during the stay of 4 days', 'facility', 'negative'], ['we would not recommend this hotel if you expect a little bit more comfort', 'loyalty', 'negative']]

271204,The location is central , there is a supermarket nearby , nice Banh - Mi - Stands around the corner and a coffee shop closeby ( E - Coffee ) . There were toilet amenities ( soap , TP , toothbrush ) . The AC was working and quiet . We booked this hotel . We arrived after a long journey , and a sign was saying : we send you a message with all booking infos to self check - in . Said message never arrived . I contacted the responsible , who was quick to answer : we have issues with the climate control we have to rebook you to another location . That ' s how we got to Supertramp . Funny thing : it happened to another lady while we were there and she told us they rebooked her because the other one was full . This hotel looks way nicer than the other - which is why we think it ' s a scam . Now , reading other reviews , I realized it happened before . Coming to Supertramp : It ' s a construction site ! At first we got offered a room with no window , which was not what we booked . They showed us another room , which we took . The room contained a kitchen and a washing - maschine ( both not working ) and a bed . The room was so tiny that we couldn ' t put our bags on the ground . Why do you put a not functioning kitchen + machine if there is no space already ? ! The cupboards were moist , some dirty towels were roting in them . The room was dirty . I made the mistake of looking behind the bed and in the cupboard - so much dirt , dust and spiderwebs . The walls are quite thin and not soundproof , so we heard everything ( from neighbors to elevator and construction work ) . We wanted to pay online , but they didn ' t accept it : only cash . As we just arrived , we didn ' t have VND yet and explained that we would contact them as soon as we did and pay the bill . We stayed 3 days . Within the first day we got contacted 3 times to ask for the money ( even though we previously made an agreement ) . In the end we got woken up by a random lady the next morning at 8a . m ( she wouldn ' t stop knocking , spoke no English , just said " money , money " . Nobody told us she would come and wake us up .

275025,Great location . Only one block from the beach and currently with ocean view ( until they build in the empty lot in front ) . Staff were lovely . Miss My My and Len were great local guides giving us ( as well as other guests ) heaps of information of places to visit and answer any questions . There was a good selection of western and local Vietnamese dishes available for breakfast like the Bahn My that was made upon request , as well as rice paper rolls , dumplings , local rice flour based cakes and coconut drink The bedroom only had one thick pillow available . I find this to be a common problem in many hotels and I always recommend to make a thick and a thin pillow available . I also think that the roof top terrace above the spa was a great place to take photos from , or where to relax but the structure felt unstable . I think it would add a great deal of value to the property if the owner fixed this up ####[['great location', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['only one block from the beach and currently with ocean view', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['staff were lovely', 'service', 'positive'], ['miss my my and len were great local guides giving us ( as well as other guests ) heaps of information of places to visit and answer any questions', 'service', 'positive'], ['good selection of western and local vietnamese dishes available for breakfast', 'service', 'positive'], ['the bedroom only had one thick pillow available', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the roof top terrace above the spa was a great place to take photos from', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['or where to relax', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the structure felt unstable', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['it would add a great deal of value to the property if the owner fixed this up', 'facility', 'neutral']]

273510,Nice looking room , spacious with a bath . Our mistake not to check but about 1 . 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started . This is a really noisy place , the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning ( 5 . 30am ) people using power tools . There are rodents in the roof . The bathroom looks great but the water doesn ' t flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over . The bath is really nice , but the hot water only fills about 1 / 5 of it at a time . Not that we would have used it , as it was too cold , but the pool was empty . Staff at reception were unwelcoming , didn ' t provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don ' t speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also , so made it hard to communicate at all . An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren ' t asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine , but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc . let alone wanted something else . We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves . When we realised this wasn ' t going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out . We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left . No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty because the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were ' unlaunderable ' and had to pay 180 , 000 dong to replace them ! So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins . So , this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam and don ' t recommend it at all .

271158,Bamboo Farmstay is where I enjoyed the most authentic Vietnamese hospitality experience of my entire trip . The owner , Nam , his sister , and the entire family were extremely kind , attentive , and caring throughout our stay . Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh , but I insisted on paying for it , as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me . Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex , a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future . I highly recommend visiting this area now , before the crowds descend . Nam ' s farmstay is a hidden gem , and I ' m glad I chose it over other homestays that were located in a cramped area with a challenging road . This farmstay , on the other hand , is situated on a good road , close to the main thoroughfare that leads to two of Ninh Binh ' s main attractions : the pagoda and the river tour . The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent , and the Vietnamese cuisine they serve is simply delicious . Although they normally close at 9 PM , they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry . While the rooms are quite basic , they offer air conditioning and hot showers , and for the price , they are an unbeatable deal - under $ 10 per night ! You ' ll also have the chance to stay in a charming bamboo bungalow , which is a real treat . All in all , I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future . I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience . ####[['the owner , nam , his sister , and the entire family were extremely kind , attentive , and caring throughout our stay', 'service', 'positive'], ['nam even lent me a traditional vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of bai dinh , but i insisted on paying for it , as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me', 'service', 'positive'], ['bamboo farmstay is conveniently located near the bai dinh temple complex , a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['i highly recommend visiting this area now', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['the farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['although they normally close at 9 pm , they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry', 'service', 'positive'], ['while the rooms are quite basic , they offer air conditioning and hot showers , and for the price , they are an unbeatable deal - under $ 10 per night', 'facility', 'positive'], ['i would definitely choose to stay at bamboo farmstay again if i return to ninh binh in the future', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['i wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine vietnamese experience', 'loyalty', 'positive']]

The hotel is also split into two so we went to the wrong hotel first - but they are only about 20 metres apart so not a big issues though we also had to go to the other hotel for breakfast , We were on the 7th floor and had to take an incredibly slow lift to the 6th floor and then stairs to the 7th - worth considering if you have mobility issues .

271192,The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport . The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance . Owner stays just next door so it ’ s easy to reach out if you have any issues provided that she ’ s at home . Room is comfy and clean . Aircon is a little weak but it works . Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair . Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin . Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin . Owner gave the pin to the metal gate via message through Booking . com ’ s app but just note that the metal gate is right in front of the apartment on the 5th floor , not the big gate on ground floor facing the street . Since the apartment is located on the 2nd street away from the main road , it ’ s not too noisy at night . The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries . There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe . The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift . Luckily there is a cement strip laid over the staircase which probably is meant for bicycles but it works fine to roll my small suitcase up . You ’ re also supposed to pay your room fee upon arrival in cash - which the fault is mine since I didn ’ t read carefully before booking . So be prepared to bring extra cash , or exchange money in the many shops at the night market . ####[['the apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the noi bai international airport', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance', 'amenity', 'neutral'], ['aircon is a little weak but it works', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair', 'facility', 'positive'], ['owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin', 'service', 'positive'], ['communication is also clear so i can do self checkin', 'service', 'positive'], ['the fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries', 'facility', 'positive'], ['there is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from asia and europe', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift', 'facility', 'negative'], ['room is comfy and clean', 'facility', 'positive']]

274961,Firstly the staff here is superb . They were all so polite and helpful and equally attentive to everyone . I have never experienced such excellent service before . I visited Vietnam 3 years ago and did not have a pleasant experience with one of the hotel . Since then I was wary of coming back here . I am glad to say that Sun river staff changed my attitude towards Vietnam and I am so glad I came back and I now have happy memories of this country .

273149,The staff were friendly and helpful . The location is good , the beach is 5 minutes on foot away and there ' s plenty of cafes , bars and restaurants nearby . It ' s quite cheap . The mattress in the room was horrible . There was a huge dent in the center . At the time the hotel was being renovated , so maybe they would have changed it out , but I think they didn ' t . The room I stayed in had no window , so it was quite stuffy , but that was expected for the price . I peeped into a renovated higher end room on that floor ( the door was open because of the construction ) , and it looked pretty good . The fridge didn ' t work ( no cooling effect whatsoever ) and the little bottles of shower gel and shampoo in the shower seemed to all be missing the little straws inside so you cannot really use the pump on it , which was weird ?! The landromat was expensive : 120 . 000vnd ( or more ) for a load of clothes . I literally paid a quarter of that for the same load in Hanoi ' s Old quarter .

273965,I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential . With its prime location opposite the beach , attentive staff , and impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products , my overall experience was positive . While the hotel showed promise in many aspects , the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay . I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel ' s recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time . It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences . However , considering the hotel had only been operational for two weeks , this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy . ####[['i recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential', 'experience', 'positive'], ['its prime location opposite the beach', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['attentive staff', 'service', 'positive'], ['impressive use of crabtree & evelyn products , my overall experience was positive', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay', 'service', 'negative'], ["i suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel ' s recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time", 'service', 'negative'], ['it would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences', 'service', 'neutral'], ['this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy', 'service', 'neutral']]

276145,The only good thing about the hotel was our room but I have to mention the fact that we had the Luxury Double room so we had a big room and those are located on the higher floors ( we were on floor 20 ) so you have a nice view and the room is bright and not tooo loud . The staff on the ground floor and the reception was also very lovely . When we saw the photos of the hotel on booking we of course were amazed by the breathtaking photos of the swimming pool on the rooftop . As we knew it will be around 37 degrees in the city during our stay that was a main fact why we booked the hotel . DON ’ T BE BLINDED BY THOSE PHOTOS ! The pool is huge and the view is nice - yess . BUT the water is disgusting . You don ’ t see it immediately because of the colourful mosaik floor but when you take a look closer you will see parts of old tissues and other dirt swimming in the pool . The rooftop area is huge but there are only a few possibilities ( around 5 - 6 daybeds ) to relax in the shadow and they are taken from early morning by people who are staying there all they long . THIS IS INSANE as the hotel must have hundreds of rooms ! ! ! ! When we went up there we had to sit on a bar chair at a high bar table without any shadow ( not to mention that the whole exterior is old , dirty and completely uncomfortable ) and we saw more and more people arriving at the rooftop just like us being disappointed by the fact that they just didn ’ t get any space to sit so they just left . I later found out that the rooftop area is not only exclusive for the guests but open for random guests and there is even free access from 4pm ! ! So the rooftop is actually a public swimming pool for 8 million people living in the city and not part of the 5star hotel you are paying for . This was so disappointing and we would never come back . As much as attentive the staff in the lobby was , less so the staff on the rooftop took any care of the fact that hotel guests were sitting on the concrete floor ( there is a small concrete “ island ” in the centre of the pool ) or cleaning dirt from people who already left … . ####[['the only good thing about the hotel was our room', 'facility', 'positive'], ['you have a nice view', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the room is bright and not tooo loud', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the reception was also very lovely', 'service', 'positive'], ['the pool is huge and the view is nice', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the water is disgusting', 'facility', 'negative'], ['when you take a look closer you will see parts of old tissues and other dirt swimming in the pool', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the rooftop area is huge but there are only a few possibilities ( around 5 - 6 daybeds ) to relax in the shadow', 'facility', 'positive'], ['this is insane as the hotel must have hundreds of rooms', 'facility', 'negative'], ['we had to sit on a bar chair at a high bar table without any shadow', 'amenity', 'negative'], ['the whole exterior is old , dirty and completely uncomfortable', 'facility', 'negative'], ['more people arriving at the rooftop just like us being disappointed by the fact that they just didn ’ t get any space to sit so they just left', 'experience', 'negative'], ['i later found out that the rooftop area is not only exclusive for the guests but open for random guests and there is even free access from 4pm', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the rooftop is actually a public swimming pool for 8 million people living in the city and not part of the 5star hotel you are paying for', 'service', 'negative'], ['this was so disappointing and we would never come back', 'loyalty', 'negative'], ['less so the staff on the rooftop took any care of the fact that hotel guests were sitting on the concrete floor', 'service', 'negative'], ['cleaning dirt from people who already left', 'service', 'negative']]

The room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning ( very necessary for Westerners visiting Vietnam in July ! ) , lovely bed and private balcony .

273542,All of the staff was super nice and very responsive to our needs . They upgraded us for free to a family room after 1 night ( we stayed 5 nights ) because they realised we were lacking space with our toddler and all our luggage . The family room was indeed much bigger , with two comfortable queen beds ! We didn ’ t try the pool because it was so rainy and not so hot , but it looked welcoming . The hotel is a 10 - min walk from the city center and there are only 6 rooms , which makes it quieter at night . We could also use the shared kitchen to cook our baby meals . Only Nhi and his girlfriend speak good English , so it can be difficult to get understood with the others . I think it ’ s part of the experience and enjoy that , but be warned . Breakfast a bit expensive for what you get , that being said I do recommend the my quang !

270085,This was our best accomodation in Vietnam . There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses . There are small pools with fish and water flowers , it is like in a fairy - tale . I really recommend the place . Our bathroom was in the back of the house , outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle . Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also . We arrived in february and the weather was perfect . Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area . This is perfect for nature lovers . The room itself was clean and spacious . Clean towels and linen . The young ladies at the reception are welkoming and very helpful with everything you need . They organised transportation , help with motorcicle or motorbike rental , offer info and help with everything . They are very kind . They organised us the boat tour to floating market and arranged us the transportation to their places and then to the airport in Can Tho based on our group needs . Excellent comunication with them . The place is in the rural area near Can Tho so it is interesting to explore the villages by bicicle and see how people live , make an idea of how the life in around water canals . There is a local - style minimarket at walking distance from the accomodation . If you dont ride bicicle or motorbike the area might look a bit remote . We found no other place to eat at walking distance but we reached a small town at 6 km of bicicle ride with the help of google maps where you can find everything . We bought some exotic interesting fruits there in the fruit market and brought them at the accomodation and enjoyed them in the eating area . The boat tour on the canals and at the floating market revealed a lot of pollution . Plastic waste floating everywhere . It is very sad to see that . Otherwise it is interesting to see the trade at the floating market . ####[['this was our best accomodation in vietnam', 'branding', 'positive'], ['there are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses', 'experience', 'positive'], ['there are small pools with fish and water flowers , it is like in a fairy - tale', 'facility', 'positive'], ['i really recommend the place', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['our bathroom was in the back of the house , outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle', 'facility', 'positive'], ['maybe inconvenient in chilly months but i undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area . this is perfect for nature lovers', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the room itself was clean and spacious . clean towels and linen', 'facility', 'positive'], ['they organised us the boat tour to floating market and arranged us the transportation to their places and then to the airport in can tho based on our group needs . excellent comunication with them', 'service', 'positive'], ['the place is in the rural area near can tho so it is interesting to explore the villages by bicicle and see how people live , make an idea of how the life in around water canals', 'experience', 'positive'], ['there is a local - style minimarket at walking distance from the accomodation', 'amenity', 'neutral'], ['if you dont ride bicicle or motorbike the area might look a bit remote', 'amenity', 'neutral'], ['we found no other place to eat at walking distance but we reached a small town at 6 km of bicicle ride with the help of google maps where you can find everything', 'amenity', 'negative'], ['the young ladies at the reception are welkoming and very helpful with everything you need', 'service', 'positive'], ['they organised transportation', 'service', 'positive'], ['help with motorcicle or motorbike rental , offer info and help with everything', 'service', 'positive'], ['they are very kind', 'service', 'positive']]

271626,Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely , airy , clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea . The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city , particularly at night . The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter ' s birthday ( highly recommend for a fun afternoon / evening ) Breakfast is great in the hotel , but there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about . Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night . Be prepared though as it was very busy on all the surrounding streets , so if you don ' t like crowds , you ' ll have to see the fire - breathing from a distance !! This is isn ' t a criticism of the hotel , but be aware there is a lot of development going on in Da Nang and lots of construction site . On one of the days there was a lot of drilling and banging coming from a nearby site and there is a stage on the beach directly below the hotel that plays loud music most night until 11pm . Also be prepared for noise form the street outside ( tooting of horns , etc ) and also the fact the beach is packed at 5 . 30am with people watching the sunrise . None of these things can be controlled by the hotel though and they didn ' t detract from our stay . In short , if you want peace and quiet Da Nang is probably not the place for you . . . . ####[['overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely , airy , clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city , particularly at night', 'facility', 'positive'], ["the staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to hue and sun world for our daughter ' s birthday", 'service', 'positive'], ['breakfast is great in the hotel', 'service', 'positive'], ['there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['our girls loved crazy cow ice cream and we also visited the dragon bridge on the saturday night', 'experience', 'positive']]

271768,Halong Bay is a must when you travel to Vietnam , and there are many options out there . We did a lot of research on the number of days to stay on the boat and also , which company to use .

The cruise was not busy and so we had the chance to be upgraded to their best suite , for free ! Views were absolutely incredible from that room . The food in the evening is also good , attention to the details was appreciated . Highly recommend this company , as it is one of our highlights of our trip .

270321,I liked everything ! The location is nice along a relatively quiet street and away from Back Beach noise . There are many restaurants on the street and easy to find food . Personnel is so nice and attentive , thank you for the young receptionist lady for many great conversations . The suite was beautiful and spacious , even has a kitchen . It was nice to have breakfast in the room . You can choose to have brekkie by the pool , in the lobby area or in your room . They even made sure to offer us glutenfree breakfast . Pool is quite small but in a nice area with sauna and steamroom which you can turn on yourself . Shower / toilet have been built against a huge rock , which makes the area quite unique . The spa upstairs is great , the massage therapists are very good , and one spa treatment is included in the room price . With the free shuttle bus you can go anywhere in the town . Motorbike can be parked in the parking hall . Whoever built the Wind hotels concept knows a lot about excellent customer service and customer retention . We definitely want to go back and can highly recommend this hotel to everyone ! It was a slight pity that rooftop area was not open . ####[['personnel is so nice and attentive , thank you for the young receptionist lady for many great conversations', 'service', 'positive'], ['the suite was beautiful and spacious , even has a kitchen', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it was nice to have breakfast in the room . you can choose to have brekkie by the pool , in the lobby area or in your room . they even made sure to offer us glutenfree breakfast', 'service', 'positive'], ['we definitely want to go back and can highly recommend this hotel to everyone', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['the location is nice along a relatively quiet street and away from back beach noise', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['there are many restaurants on the street and easy to find food', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['pool is quite small but in a nice area with sauna and steamroom which you can turn on yourself', 'facility', 'positive'], ['shower / toilet have been built against a huge rock , which makes the area quite unique', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the spa upstairs is great , the massage therapists are very good , and one spa treatment is included in the room price', 'service', 'positive'], ['with the free shuttle bus you can go anywhere in the town', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['motorbike can be parked in the parking hall', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['whoever built the wind hotels concept knows a lot about excellent customer service and customer retention', 'service', 'positive']]

273387,Incredibly comfortable bed . Great location . Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements . Preface : Their claim is " Beyond Perfection " and it is marketed as a " Luxury Boutique " 5 star hotel . While beautifully designed , many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience ( function of light switches , relative position of shower and towel for maximum water coverage of said towels , maintenance work during check - out hours ) and some elements already are showing wear and tear . For a 5 star hotel , the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training , with very odd formalities that were unnecessary , poorly executed , or just awkward . We also received a phone call to our room at 4 : 48am , which was a mistake by reception . When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves .

276550,Its been an outstanding experience indeed one of a kind . It ' s been 2 years that I am planning on visiting a farm in my next visit to Vietnam , I really wanted to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of the Saigon , and here I am in a magical place , surrounded by beautiful rice fields . The farm is simple and yet very special , one can tell that it was built with love and respect to nature but also for the best traveler experience . If that ' s not enough , the host was super welcoming , it felt safe , warm , and yet very much private when I wanted to have my space . The room is made of bamboo and natural materials and was spacious and functional . About 10 drive from the farm there is a national park on the Mekong River , the host gave me a ride there and arranged 90 minutes boat ride , this site was also great , nice river and lots of Birds and some Buffalo on the river bank , seeing the sunset on the background of the vast land of the Mekong was beautiful . I am the kind of person that wants to know what he eats , and during this visit I was amazed by the creativity of the Vietnamese cuisine , the host invited me to choose herbs and flowers from the farm ’ s garden and then cooked delicious local dishes with them accompanied by beef , chicken , and seafood , it was really cool experience that made the lunch and dinner a rewarding experience , I guess there is something about eating what you picked up 2 ago … In terms of accessibility , the host was accommodating as well , guide me where to buy the bus tickets from Ho Chi Minh City , picked me up with his motorcycle from the local bus station , and took me over to the farm which was around 5 minutes drive . If you are curious about the authentic countryside this is the right place if you are well - traveled , and I am , then I am quite certain that you ’ re after some new memorable experiences . Look no further :) I will be back again , no doubt about that . The mattress , it ' s not a huge issue but I would recommend having it a bit more thicker . ####[['its been an outstanding experience indeed one of a kind', 'experience', 'positive'], ['i am in a magical place , surrounded by beautiful rice fields', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the host was super welcoming', 'service', 'positive'], ['it felt safe , warm , and yet very much private when i wanted to have my space', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the room is made of bamboo and natural materials and was spacious and functional', 'facility', 'positive'], ['this site was also great , nice river', 'experience', 'positive'], ['seeing the sunset on the background of the vast land of the mekong was beautiful', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the host invited me to choose herbs and flowers from the farm ’ s garden and then cooked delicious local dishes with them accompanied by beef , chicken , and seafood , it was really cool experience that made the lunch and dinner a rewarding experience', 'experience', 'positive'], ['in terms of accessibility , the host was accommodating as well , guide me where to buy the bus tickets from ho chi minh city', 'service', 'positive'], ['picked me up with his motorcycle from the local bus station', 'service', 'positive'], ['took me over to the farm which was around 5 minutes drive', 'service', 'positive'], ['if you are curious about the authentic countryside this is the right place if you are well - traveled', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['i will be back again , no doubt about that', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ["the mattress , it ' s not a huge issue but i would recommend having it a bit more thicker", 'facility', 'neutral'], ['the host gave me a ride there and arranged 90 minutes boat ride', 'service', 'positive']]
273984,Our stay at Azerai was great . The staff were friendly and super attentive , and the facilities were nice and new . From the moment we were picked up , we were very well taken care of . One minor issue of an old razor being found in our room was made up for with a room upgrade . Food in the restaurant was good , albeit a little pricey but options in Can Tho were easy to access . The staff were great in recommending various places to visit . The highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local ’ s house while we waited for the rain to pass . Everything was super genuine and authentic - The guide , also a resort employee , grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing ! Lastly the hotel transfer from Ho Chi Minh City was excellent - a comfortable limousine van which made the two hour trip each way enjoyable . Would recommend to visit , and stay in the Lake rooms . We started in the Garden Room , but the view from the Lake Room is better . If possible try avoid the weekends and local school holidays as the resort is much quieter . It was overall GREAT value for money , however the experiences / tours and the restaurant were a bit on the pricier side . ####[['our stay at azerai was great', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the staff were friendly and super attentive ,', 'service', 'positive'], ['the facilities were nice and new', 'facility', 'positive'], ['from the moment we were picked up , we were very well taken care of', 'service', 'positive'], ['food in the restaurant was good , albeit a little pricey but options in can tho were easy to access', 'service', 'positive'], ['the staff were great in recommending various places to visit', 'service', 'positive'], ['the highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local ’ s house while we waited for the rain to pas', 'experience', 'positive'], ['everything was super genuine and authentic', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the guide , also a resort employee , grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing', 'service', 'positive'], ['made the two hour trip each way enjoyable', 'experience', 'positive'], ['would recommend to visit , and stay in the lake rooms', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['we started in the garden room , but the view from the lake room is better', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['if possible try avoid the weekends and local school holidays as the resort is much quieter', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['it was overall great value for money', 'experience', 'positive'], ['however the experiences / tours and the restaurant were a bit on the pricier side', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['lastly the hotel transfer from ho chi minh city was excellent - a comfortable limousine van', 'service', 'positive'], ['one minor issue of an old razor being found in our room was made up for with a room upgrade', 'experience', 'neutral']]

The breakfasts were my favourite from all the hotels on our trip so far . The highlight is definitely the staff . Vy ( not sure if I have the spelling right ) and Hanna were the standouts , they went out of their way to ask about our stay and give very personalized tips while here . But really all the staff went above and beyond for us . The hotel is a short walk ( or even shorter bike ride ) into the old town . I really felt at home here . The only issue we had was with the bikes . My partner is 6 feet tall and none of the bikes were quite big enough for him . ####[['this place is incredible', 'branding', 'positive'], ['really comfortable , well furnished and spacious enough room', 'facility', 'positive'], ['impeccably clean', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the breakfasts were my favourite from all the hotels on our trip so far', 'service', 'positive'], ['the highlight is definitely the staff', 'service', 'positive'], ['hanna were the standouts , they went out of their way to ask about our stay and give very personalized tips while here', 'service', 'positive'], ['all the staff went above and beyond for us', 'service', 'positive'], ['i really felt at home here', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the hotel is a short walk ( or even shorter bike ride ) into the old town', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['ours had a lovely view over the water', 'experience', 'positive']]

We decided to have one item made as a test for the experience ( not good : pushing to sell and don ' t give a damn how the finished garment looks on you ) . As soon as we got back to the hotel , the hotel lady double checked with us if we had indeed only ordered one item ( she already knew ) at her recommended shop ( commission ) .

270385,The pool was nice . The location ( close to the night market ) was also good . I would really not recommend this hotel . We are by no means picky people and have travelled extensively , but this is one of the worst hotels we have ever encountered in terms of price / quality . The room was not cleaned before our arrival ( two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom ) , it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it , thus also no clean towels . The place did not only have cockroaches upon arrival , but we kept encountering them . Although we know this might just be the climate , we did not encounter them anywhere else during 3 weeks in Vietnam . The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up , which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm . The water pressure was almost non existent . The airconditioning did not work most of the time . Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible . The staff did not speak a word of English . We had to communicate via Google translate . Overall , this place calls itself a resort , but in comparison with some of the significantly lower priced homestays or other hotels we had throughout three weeks in Vietnam , we would barely call this place a hotel and definitely not a resort . The sun was not present during our 3 days in Phu Quoc , but the ' cosy ' part of ' suncosy ' was even more absent than the sun . ####[['the pool was nice', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the location ( close to the night market ) was also good', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['i would really not recommend this hotel', 'loyalty', 'negative'], ['the room was not cleaned before our arrival ( two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom ) , it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it , thus also no clean towels', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up , which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the water pressure was almost non existent .', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the airconditioning did not work most of the time', 'facility', 'negative'], ['most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible', 'service', 'negative'], ['the staff did not speak a word of english . we had to communicate via google translate', 'service', 'negative'], ['this place calls itself a resort , but in comparison with some of the significantly lower priced homestays or other hotels we had throughout three weeks in vietnam', 'branding', 'negative']]

274346,The location of this hostel is good , about a 10 minute motorbike ride from the beach and there are some lovely local bars , restaurants and tailors in the surrounding area as well . The staff were pleasant and friendly , with good recommendations and great English skills . They switched us to a different room quickly and without a hassle when my friend and I didn ' t want to share our hostel room with loud guests . This hostel is very dominated by English backpackers and so it caters to a very party / drinking oriented crowd , so if this is not what you ' re looking for this is probably not the place for you . While the pool is a nice addition , it ' s rather small . The breakfast provided was really lacking variety though , and what they did have was not very nice . We were also given stained towels to use and when we asked for new ones they were stained as well .

269977,absolutely gorgeous , even better in real life - felt like a boutique - y four seasons . the bar on the top floor was beautiful and all of the food at the restaurant fantastic . whoever designed or built the hotel is clearly a world traveler with impeccable taste . gym was really nice too ( did not take advantage of the spa ) service was great except at the pool - constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the ( quite large ) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don ’ t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down . It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting , you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes . Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment , you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot ( or didn ’ t understand because of language barrier ? ) . Then by then the food is cold . Frequently saw 2 - 3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention . Also , the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours ( this was a Monday afternoon ) stirring up lots of insects . Why isn ’ t this done early morning or evening when there are less people trying to enjoy the pool ? If it weren ’ t for the pool experience being unpleasant , I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation . Because of this , I don ’ t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn ’ t enjoyable to sit by the pool . But we still would come back for the rooms , gym and food . ####[['absolutely gorgeous , even better in real life', 'experience', 'positive'], ['all of the food at the restaurant fantastic', 'service', 'positive'], ['the bar on the top floor was beautiful', 'facility', 'positive'], ['felt like a boutique - y four seasons', 'experience', 'positive'], ['gym was really nice too', 'facility', 'positive'], ['service was great except at the pool', 'service', 'neutral'], ['constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the ( quite large ) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don ’ t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down', 'service', 'negative'], ['then when food is served and you ask for a condiment , you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot', 'service', 'negative'], ['then by then the food is cold', 'service', 'negative'], ['frequently saw 2 - 3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention', 'service', 'negative'], ['the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours', 'experience', 'negative'], ['stirring up lots of insects', 'experience', 'negative'], ['i don ’ t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn ’ t enjoyable to sit by the pool', 'loyalty', 'negative'], ['but we still would come back for the rooms , gym and food', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['if it weren ’ t for the pool experience being unpleasant , i would say this is the perfect place for a staycation', 'branding', 'neutral'], ['it was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting', 'service', 'negative'], ['you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes', 'service', 'negative']]

271055,Our experience at Zizi homestay in Sapa was a spiritual journey that allowed us to witness the sacred rituals and beliefs of the Hmong community . The lodge , surrounded by towering peaks , provided a breathtaking setting for our trek . The guided trek led us through sacred sites , ancient temples , and shared moments of spiritual reflection . Each step felt like a step towards embracing the sacred wisdom of Hmong culture . The reverent hosts guided us through traditional ceremonies , offering us insight into their spiritual practices . Back at the lodge , we were treated to a sacred ritual , witnessing the deep reverence the Hmong have for their ancestors and nature . As the sun set , we gathered for a contemplative meditation session , enveloped in the profound tranquility of the mountains . While our overall experience was fantastic , some guests noticed occasional water supply disruptions , which added to the rustic charm but might cause minor inconveniences .

270426,This hotel is situated in a side street just off the main coast road . It took me 2 minutes to walk ( stroll ) to the beach . This is a very well maintained hotel . The rooms are cleaned and serviced daily . Toiletries are supplied along with free drinking water . There was always hot water available for the hand basin and shower There is also a lockable draw that I used without any concern or issue . Mrs Phoung , receptionist / director is pleasant and very helpful . The housekeeping staff were polite and considerate . There is no food available but closeby are restaurants , cafes and marts a plenty . The price is very reasonable for this quality of hotel . I highly recommend that you give this hotel your consideration . Not that it was in anyway a concern to me but guests should be aware that the smaller rooms do not have a view from the window . But with such a beautiful beach nearby why would you spend the day in your room . ####[['this hotel is situated in a side street just off the main coast road . it took me 2 minutes to walk ( stroll ) to the beach', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the rooms are cleaned and serviced daily . toiletries are supplied along with free drinking water . there was always hot water available for the hand basin and shower', 'facility', 'positive'], ['mrs phoung , receptionist / director is pleasant and very helpful . the housekeeping staff were polite and considerate', 'service', 'positive'], ['there is no food available but closeby are restaurants , cafes and marts a plenty', 'service', 'negative'], ['the price is very reasonable for this quality of hotel', 'experience', 'positive'], ['i highly recommend that you give this hotel your consideration', 'loyalty', 'positive']]
273850,The staff at the Solaria Hotel were absolutely wonderful , everyone was kind , helpful and friendly . The room ( 401 ) was at the front of the hotel with a french balcony overlooking the road , but as it was in the old quarter of the city this is normal . The reception area was comfortable , the dining room on floor 8 was bright and airy and breakfast had a good choice of fruit , yogurt , pastries and bread and a choice of cooked eggs . We had an evening meal after a long day out and it was exceptional , lots of menu choices , beautifully presented and very delicious . The hotel explains that whilst it is in a convenient part of the city , the views and space are not as good as the larger hotels but it makes up for that by providing excellent care and dedication and believe me that is exactly what they do . Nothing is too much trouble and all the staff go the extra mile to make your stay pleasurable .

270621,The food and service staff were all excellent . I found the booking process very irritating , I received several Whats App calls and texts in the days before the cruise from the sales consultant Hang Nga telling me she had a big problem because she had double booked my room , she wanted me to spend one night in a cheaper room then move to my original booked room for the second night . I found her texts to be increasingly bizarre and late at night . She then told me she had a sick child and needed my help . She then offered to buy me a drink in Hanoi if I would just accept her plan to use the cheaper room . She was concerned about her job and realised she had made a big mistake . I was paying a lot of money for this cruise and did not want to move rooms . I told her it was her problem and she would have to fix it . I was traveling with friends and wanted to treat myself to a nice room on this cruise . Her constant texts caused me al lot of unnecessary stress in the days before getting on the cruise . The 2nd day outing wasn ' t very interesting .

276214,A clear 5 out of 5 stars for this accommodation ! It is truly home away from home . We stayed here for 4 nights and the experience was lovely . Vincent ' s family is really accommodating - mom prepares breakfast , cousin taking over the reception , Vincent himself entertains the guests and makes sure that everything is going well . Location is about 10 - 15 mins of relaxed walking to the Ancient Town . You just needed to ring them up for the exact location as the place is not that easy to find ( situated in the small alleys ) .

But the highlight was the service . I travel a lot both privately and through work , and I can honestly say that the amicable and flexible service of San and his colleague ' s was at the same level as Asian luxury boutique hotels at 20x the cost . They helped me out with everything I needed , always with a smile , and I felt completely taken care of whether I needed help with my luggage , transportation , local advice or booking trips .

270130,For our wedding anniversary celebration , my family decided to stay at this lovely resort called Memorina . And wow , did it surpass our expectations ! Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery , it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape . The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat , bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region . We spent hours wandering around the resort , discovering charming nooks , admiring the vibrant plant life , and even giving fishing a shot . One of the highlights was visiting the sheepfold – an experience that not only captivated us but also filled our kids with wide - eyed wonder . Watching their faces light up as they interacted with the sheep was absolutely heartwarming .

270231,The hotel itself and the staff deserve a five star rating . The facilities of the hotel , the interior design , the standard of the rooms are high class . There is absolutely nothing missing to enjoy a wonderful stay . The Spa is well equipped , offers a great variety of treatments by experienced , well trained therapists . The restaurant on the basement floor offers a huge breakfast buffet , western and Asian style plus a menue . Lunch and dinner has separate menue with various dishes at reasonable prices . Service is attentive and especially at breakfast there is no request they wouldn ' t satisfy . Even for breakfast they ask for your allergies ! There is a rooftop bar with happy hour and a view from the 5th floor . The other bar is in the lobby . My room offered much more than I expected : apart from safe , TV , hairdryer and water kettle , there is a fridge , free water , tea , coffee and fruits . The bed is so comfortable you don ' t want to get out , as is the linen and towels from very good quality . Enough plugs to recharge your electronic equipment . Lights are also good and enough . Bathroom with all amenities . Of course there is an elevator in the house . The location is great . The staff speaks good English and is more than helpful in any way .

272025,The location was quite central so we booked the hotel in believe that it ’ s a 4 star hotel . But unfortunately it was a complete betray and Desaster . Don ’ t ever book this hotel ! We booked 2 rooms and both were extremely dirty and many things were broken . Furthermore , it ’ s stated on the internet as a 4 star hotel but it is a betray . When asking the receptionist , he said it ’ s 3 star and they ’ re renovating it to turn into 4 star in the future . This is clearly not ok since the price was like a 4 star too . When arriving , the hotelier was unfriendly and wanted to cheat us with a cheaper room without view . But that ’ s not what we booked . So after some discussion we received the rooms we booked but both were shockingly dirty . Fatty fingerprints everywhere , dust and dirt just like nobody cleaned the rooms for months . We originally booked for 2 nights but had to leave after 7 hours immediately to find a new hotel since it was so gross and we couldn ’ t sleep the whole night . After addressing these issues to the hotelier he was very rude and still wanted to charge us . It took us half a day to find a new hotel and to discuss those problems and our holidays were ruined .

274053,New hotel , ok location Quite simply , the hotel lied . . . about many things . Lie 1 ) I booked this hotel for my wife ' s birthday as it has a spa centre , as per the info on their website . There is NO operating spa centre . When I asked about this I was told it was still under construction and that if I wanted to book a spa we can walk around the corner . Lie 2 ) I ' m training for a triathlon so when I saw that the fitness centre is open 24 hours , I thought great ! The gym closes at 7pm and is NOT 24 hours . Also , the treadmills don ' t work . The belt stalls with each step so you can ' t even walk let alone run . And there are no sanitizing wipes , towels , bins or even access to water . Lie 3 ) The sunset bar looked great on their website , especially with the snacks and " signature cocktails " noted . There are NO cocktails and no snacks . And what the heck is the point of a pool and bar that closes at 7pm ? I kept being told , not enough staff . Lie 4 ) The restaurant ' 12 Kitchen ' is listed on their website as serving a buffet breakfast and dinner . There is NO dinner served and the breakfast closes at 9 : 30am . Lie 5 ) The hotel is listed on booking . com as 5 stars ? ! I ' m not sure on which planet they got this rating but it is a 3 star at best . Definitely not an international standard 5 star . There is also , NO room service and nothing in the mini bar in the rooms . The rooms are ok , but . . . Upon arrival , the top shelves in the wardrobes were very dusty and we had to wipe them down before using them . The rooms were relatively clean but definitely not to a high standard . Housekeeping staff didn ' t even wash the glasses on a number of occasions . There is only a kettle with a couple of sachets of coffee issued . The toilets . . . . oh the toilets . . . if you plan on using anything more than 3 individual squares of toilet paper , be prepared for a blocked toilet .

Hotel is located at a place where it is walking distance , most of the old quarter areas and some beyond could be covered by walking . It ' s quite chaotic to walk in the narrow streets where traffic is both ways but it was very much fun . Coming from India , it was not very different to the experience in India . We booked the tour guide via the hotel and it was very good . The hotel staff advised us clearly about the charges , gave recommendations to what sort of tour we must go for based on the time we had . Overall it was a very satisfying holiday .

But we made the best choice having breakfast cooked by Thong ' s mum . They also arranged floating market tour and taxi back to Saigon through their travel agent , Lily . All were extremly helpful . Please just be aware that at times it can get noisy if there is a wedding party nearby or any kind of celebration for that matter as karaoke will be sung to mark the occasion . Not only here , I mean , but in all areas of Mekong delta , as we were staying in diffrrent locations , to see different parts of the Delta . Best to have some ear plugs , just in case .

I went inside to pay and found out he ( security guard ) could not administer payment . He had trouble getting ahold of the man in charge of reception . Meanwhile my bus driver was beginning to unload our things and was attempting to kick us off the bus as we were now behind schedule . I pleaded to him , explaining that the hotel had my credit info and I could be billed , and made the same plea to the security guard . To no avail . I was now refusing to get off the bus because I had a flight to catch , and caught between two men screaming at eachother and at me . I ' m not sure I ' ve faced that level of anxiety before in my life . All due to a false promise of 24 hour reception .

272606,Our stay at Hanoi Media Hotel and Spa made our trip to Hanoi perfect . The location of the hotel in the Old Quarter is fantastic if you want to be near Hoan Kiem Lake . We were literally 2 minutes walk from the Huc Bridge . We made full use of the amazing location and spent many hours happily exploring the Old Quarter . The team at Hanoi Media did an amazing job looking after us . We arrived in the city via train in the early hours of the morning and went directly to the hotel . I had let them know about our early arrival and they had said if they couldn ' t accommodate an early check in for us , they would keep our luggage for us until our rooms were ready . As soon as we arrived they prepared a free room for us , at a minimal charge , which we could use for the next 6 hours to freshen up and rest while we waited for our booked rooms to be vacated and cleaned for us . In addition , when checking out , they made one of our rooms available for a late check out , so we could pack and leave the hotel as late as possible . This willingness to ensure our comfort and convenience was maintained throughout our stay and was hugely appreciated by us . They also stored and kept our luggage for us when we checked out to spend 2 nights at Ha Long Bay . Our rooms were great . We booked the Junior Suite with Terrace , and when returning from Ha Long Bay , stayed in the Junior Suite with Balcony . Both rooms were lovely . The Junior Suite with Terrace is an extremely large room with lovely space to move around , and we loved the Junior Suite with Balcony for its fantastic views over the city where we could sit and admire the city lights and sounds . Our second room was the Superior Double Room which served perfectly for our teenage daughters . This was a quiet , safe space where they could sleep in and relax when taking some time off from exploring the city . We enjoyed the Lux Skybar , and the kind doormen at the entrance to the hotel . Always on hand with a smile and warm greeting . While the location is ideal for being a part of the Old Quarter , it is worth it to know that on weekends the area around Hoan Kiem Lake is extremely busy and loud with music . Thankfully the hotel accommodates this very well and we could close the sliding doors of our rooms and were not disturbed by the city noise and music at all . ####[['our stay at hanoi media hotel and spa made our trip to hanoi perfect', 'service', 'positive'], ['the location of the hotel in the old quarter is fantastic if you want to be near hoan kiem lake', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['we were literally 2 minutes walk from the huc bridge', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['we made full use of the amazing location and spent many hours happily exploring the old quarter', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the team at hanoi media did an amazing job looking after us', 'service', 'positive'], ["i had let them know about our early arrival and they had said if they couldn ' t accommodate an early check in for us , they would keep our luggage for us until our rooms were ready", 'service', 'positive'], ['as soon as we arrived they prepared a free room for us , at a minimal charge , which we could use for the next 6 hours to freshen up and rest while we waited for our booked rooms to be vacated and cleaned for us', 'service', 'positive'], ['when checking out , they made one of our rooms available for a late check out , so we could pack and leave the hotel as late as possible', 'service', 'positive'], ['this willingness to ensure our comfort and convenience was maintained throughout our stay and was hugely appreciated by us', 'service', 'positive'], ['they also stored and kept our luggage for us when we checked out to spend 2 nights at ha long bay', 'service', 'positive'], ['our rooms were great . we booked the junior suite with terrace , and when returning from ha long bay , stayed in the junior suite with balcony . both rooms were lovely', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the junior suite with terrace is an extremely large room with lovely space to move around , and we loved the junior suite with balcony for its fantastic views over the city where we could sit and admire the city lights and sounds', 'facility', 'positive'], ['our second room was the superior double room which served perfectly for our teenage daughters', 'facility', 'positive'], ['this was a quiet , safe space where they could sleep in and relax when taking some time off from exploring the city', 'experience', 'positive'], ['we enjoyed the lux skybar , and the kind doormen at the entrance to the hotel', 'facility', 'positive'], ['always on hand with a smile and warm greeting', 'service', 'positive'], ['thankfully the hotel accommodates this very well and we could close the sliding doors of our rooms and were not disturbed by the city noise and music at all', 'experience', 'positive']]

276951,Very new hotel , our stay was at the very end of August 2022 and we were told the hotel has only been open for 10 days . - Trendy decorations and good ambiance . - Perfect location to explore the Old Quarter of Hanoi . - Good breakfast , we enjoyed the Pho , fresh juices and fruits especially . Restaurant staff extremely friendly . - Adding to the fact that it is new , everything is nice and clean . Every time we were coming back to the hotel after sightseeing in the city , it just felt like a breath of fresh air , since the streets of Hanoi can be very overwhelming with the traffic , the heat , the trash and vermin , our room in the spotlessly clean hotel felt like a safe haven where we can actually relax . - Staff are super attentive and always with a good attitude . Everyone is always smiling and it makes you feel very welcome . Bellmen would literally run over and open the hotel main entrance door for you when they see you approaching from the street , and they were also very sweet and ask if we would like an umbrella if it is raining or the sun is too strong . The front desk staff helped us to store our suitcases for a few hours after we came back from a 3 - day Halong Bay Cruise , helped us to communicate with our Grab driver over the phone . - There were still constructions going on in the hotel ( like the sky bar and spa were not yet ready during our stay ) . - Walls of the room are not really sound proof , you can hear people talking and walking in the corridor and the construction sounds , but this goes for most of the hotels in the Old Quarter according to our research . - The air conditioning vent is right on top of the bed and makes it quite uncomfortable for me to sleep , ( my husband ' s side was not affected as much ) , we could not switch it off because it was quite hot in Hanoi when we were there , but the room is quite small ( as always , it is a norm in most hotels in the Old Quarter ) , so there is literally no where else they can put the vent . ####[['trendy decorations and good ambiance', 'facility', 'positive'], ['perfect location to explore the old quarter of hanoi', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['good breakfast , we enjoyed the pho , fresh juices and fruits especially', 'service', 'positive'], ['restaurant staff extremely friendly', 'service', 'positive'], ['adding to the fact that it is new , everything is nice and clean', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it just felt like a breath of fresh air', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the streets of hanoi can be very overwhelming with the traffic , the heat , the trash and vermin', 'experience', 'negative'], ['our room in the spotlessly clean', 'facility', 'positive'], ['hotel felt like a safe haven where we can actually relax', 'experience', 'positive'], ['staff are super attentive and always with a good attitude', 'service', 'positive'], ['everyone is always smiling and it makes you feel very welcome', 'service', 'positive'], ['bellmen would literally run over and open the hotel main entrance door for you when they see you approaching from the street', 'service', 'positive'], ['they were also very sweet and ask if we would like an umbrella if it is raining or the sun is too strong', 'service', 'positive'], ['the front desk staff helped us to store our suitcases for a few hours after we came back from a 3 - day halong bay cruise , helped us to communicate with our grab driver over the phone', 'service', 'positive'], ['walls of the room are not really sound proof , you can hear people talking and walking in the corridor and the construction sounds', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the air conditioning vent is right on top of the bed and makes it quite uncomfortable for me to sleep', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the room is quite small ( as always , it is a norm in most hotels in the old quarter )', 'facility', 'negative'], ['this goes for most of the hotels in the old quarter according to our research', 'amenity', 'positive']]

273791,Pool area was really nice , rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable . I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer . Staff very friendly . After ordering a sandwich the bar tender took my payment card away to reception , I presumed to bring a card machine or to swipe my card at reception . There was some misunderstanding and I thought he was asking for my room number but sometime later I got a failed chip and pin attempt notification , he had exceeded the amount of pin attempts and my card was permanently blocked ! After several correspondence with my bank about how to unblock it I found out that : The card can only be unblocked in the U . K . For the rest of the trip I was unable to use my card ! He probably was trying to provide extra service and be helpful , or maybe it is a cultural difference but in the U . K . no one would ever give their PIN number to someone else , especially a staff member or stranger so we would never even suspect that a member of hotel staff was asking for a PIN number and not a room number . I was annoyed to say the least and even asked them to remove the service charge . At the end they still kept the charge on and I even added somesmall tip because felt bad for the guy who made a mistake , he did also give me a complimentary cola . Though if this happened in Europe at a luxury hotel or resort the sandwich would have lest been complimented in full . Be very careful and never let anyone walk away with your card !

271155,We arrived late to this charming hotel , check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade . Our room was well appointed , just as pictured in the photos with a very comfortable bed . In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields . Both the ladies at reception , Xí and Vân , took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind . From helping us book taxis , tours ( we booked Golden Bridge ) , laundry services , massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning , they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional . They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight ! This hotel is located halfway between An Bang Beach and Hoi An Old Town , in a peaceful , tranquil rural setting . It ’ s ideally situated for day trips like basket boat tours and even Tra Que Culinary Village . We loved being able to see the farmers work the land in this authentic setting and walking to nearby little cafés . We used the free bicycles to explore the area a few times , which was very pleasant . It would be a quick 10 - 15 minute bike ride into town . The pool was a little too cold for us during our one week stay in February , but it was still lovely to sit around on the comfy loungers and listen to the trickling water , like a little oasis . The gentleman who works on the grounds doesn ’ t speak English , but he works very hard to maintain the property , is the hotel ’ s security , gardener and I ’ m sure whatever else needs doing . Our hats off to him ! We Canadians highly recommend this little gem of a hotel just outside the busy area . We ’ d like to thank the staff at Maison Fleur Hoi An for a wonderful stay ! Occasionally we had to be patient to get a Grab taxi to come and pick us up at the property as it ' s a little out of the way .

273545,All the staff were lovely . In particular Thuy and Ahn . We were made to feel like family and they went out of their way to make our stay more enjoyable . The hotel owner was also lovely , she even gifted us on departure , which is a beautiful and very appreciated gesture . The team of staff are very small and we ’ re mostly all lovely . The rooms were beautiful and way above the standard of what we paid . Breakfast was good there were both western and plenty of Vietnamese options , but the fruit selection in the morning was always fresh and plentiful . The staff always ask if you want anything special cooked for breakfast and went out of their way to order us yummy pho for breakfast ( they don ’ t usually have this on the menu . The pool is actually bigger than what we expected and was made great use of during the hot Hoi An summer heat . Overall excellent value for money There wasn ’ t a lot to fault about this hotel . If I have to be picky , it was probably further away from market then we imagined . But it was extremely hot when we were there , and we aren ’ t game enough for motorcycles , so it may have felt further away then it was . Vihn ( I think that ’ s his name , the only male front concierge ) can work on his customer service skills . He could see we were checking out and lots of suitcases , given we had to walk down three flights of stairs , he could have at least offered to assist . He ’ s probably the worst concierge I ’ ve dealt with in my time in Vietnam . But he wasn ’ t enough to ruin my stay .

270122,They were all very nice , and the hotel is really central . We arrived late at night , so we asked for a transfer from the airport . The lady was very nice to us , but we realised that we would pay 400 . 000 vd , which is a lot for this transfer from the airport . ( If we had gone by taxi , we would pay only around 130 . 000 vd . . . ) When we got to the hotel , a really nice man was there to receive us . The small room that we booked had no windows , so we upgraded to the bigger room . The hotel is OK , not fancy ( we have to watch out for the cockroachs ) , but it ' s really central , and we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night , and also the air - conditioning machine outside ( which is normal in Vietnam ) . When we were leaving , we asked the man if he could please call a taxi , and we expected no more fees from the hotel . Until we realised that the lady came to collect our money , saying that her car would take us to the airport ( for 220 . 000 vd ) . Of course , it was not her car , and she paid the taxi and got a fee from our money . We ' re not sure how much she paid the taxi , but it should be around 120 . 000 vd , and the rest of the 100 . 000 vd went to her pocket . It wasn ' t correct of her , and we felt robbed .

The wife / owner of the place sat down and talked to us for 2 + hours when we showed up , and it was such amazing conversation . She told us all about her and her husbands ( who was also amazing but spoke little English ) struggle to start a hostel in their city . She spoke almost better English than me and I ' m American born and raised . Me and my buddy sincerely and thoroughly loved the stay and talking with her and would love to visit again .

274238,We stayed at Golden Holiday for a few days , in a total of 3 rooms . I ' m going to give you lots of details about our stay , so you can see if it is right for you . Short story - we really enjoyed it ! First the rooms - rooms are quite large , with very nice sheets , towels , pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers . We ' re not talking super high - end , but for the price the rooms are great . Some rooms have a small sofa - ask if your room has one , or request one . Wi - fi worked great > Toilets worked well , with nice bidets attached . If you want a large , comfortable room - I don ' t think you can go wrong here . Staff - staff are great . This place is well staffed , there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk , always willing to go out of their way for you . Especially Thuy and Ms . Kim - they are fantastic and will help make your stay very enjoyable . They often called " electric shuttles " for us , which worked well for transporting 5 people from 1 - 3km away . Breakfast - there is a large breakfast buffet available every day from 7 to 10AM . Ours was included in the room rates . There was great coffee , also fruits , salads , asian , and some western items . Some days there were bacon and chocolate crossaints . You could always get eggs cooked anyway you liked . No pancakes or waffles , but I don ' t think these are very common in Vietnam . It was easy to grab some pastries to go from the breakfast buffet so you had some snacks for later on . Pool - there was a medium sized pool outside . It was nice , clean - not super huge but large enough to do laps in it . Location - it is located right on a semi - busy street , but we never heard noise from our rooms , as it is set back a bit from the road . There are plenty of spas and restaurants in the area - but you are outside of the super busy , noisy " old town " tourist area . It is a quick 5 min electric shuttle ride ($ 2 usd ) or a 22 minute walk to the main " old town " walking areas . ####[['we really enjoyed it', 'experience', 'positive'], ['rooms are quite large , with very nice sheets , towels , pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers', 'facility', 'positive'], ["we ' re not talking super high - end , but for the price the rooms are great", 'experience', 'positive'], ['some rooms have a small sofa', 'facility', 'positive'], ['wi - fi worked great', 'facility', 'positive'], ['toilets worked well , with nice bidets attached', 'facility', 'positive'], ['staff are great', 'service', 'positive'], ['this place is well staffed , there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk , always willing to go out of their way for you . especially thuy and ms . kim - they are fantastic and will help make your stay very enjoyable', 'service', 'positive'], ['they often called " electric shuttles " for us , which worked well for transporting 5 people from 1 - 3km away', 'service', 'positive'], ['there is a large breakfast buffet available every day from 7 to 10am', 'service', 'positive'], ['ours was included in the room rates', 'service', 'positive'], ['there was great coffee , also fruits , salads , asian , and some western items', 'service', 'positive'], ['some days there were bacon and chocolate crossaints', 'service', 'positive'], ['you could always get eggs cooked anyway you liked', 'service', 'positive'], ['it was easy to grab some pastries to go from the breakfast buffet so you had some snacks for later on', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['there was a medium sized pool outside', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it was nice , clean - not super huge but large enough to do laps in it', 'facility', 'positive'], ['it is located right on a semi - busy street', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['but we never heard noise from our rooms', 'experience', 'positive'], ['it is set back a bit from the road', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['there are plenty of spas and restaurants in the area - but you are outside of the super busy , noisy " old town " tourist area', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['it is a quick 5 min electric shuttle ride', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['or a 22 minute walk to the main " old town " walking areas', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['we stayed at golden holiday for a few days , in a total of 3 rooms', 'experience', 'neutral']]

273994,We did an extensive review ( in person as well ) of all the hotels in the area and I would say this one is the best one . The design of the hotel is super nice , with a very warm and crafty feeling ! The views are absolutely gorgeous . The rooms are big and comfortable . I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics . The room was clean , bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white . The maintenance of the hotel is not the best , which is a real pity , because it was designed so nicely . When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage . The hot water is very inconsistent when showering , sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself ! Some staff is nice , others not so much . I think the language barrier is the biggest problem because almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude , which I don ' t think it ' s their intention . I would suggest the management trains the people a bit better . ####[['the design of the hotel is super nice , with a very warm and crafty feeling', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the views are absolutely gorgeous', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the rooms are big and comfortable', 'facility', 'positive'], ['i really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the room was clean , bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the maintenance of the hotel is not the best , which is a real pity , because it was designed so nicely', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['when there is heavy rain there can be water leakage .', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the hot water is very inconsistent when showering , sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself', 'facility', 'negative'], ['some staff is nice', 'service', 'positive'], ['almost none speak english well and they can be perceived as rude', 'service', 'negative'], ['i think the language barrier is the biggest problem', 'experience', 'neutral'], ['i would suggest the management trains the people a bit better', 'service', 'neutral'], ['all the hotels in the area and i would say this one is the best one', 'branding', 'positive']]

By far the most exceptional part of the experience was the staff , who went above and beyond to make our stay special . They even surprised me with a birthday cake and sang happy birthday to me at dinner ! And they also decorated our room with rose petals and a hand - written card . So special !

270048,First impressions - amazing use of space and a great meet and greet . Breakfast - excellent , very fresh and different each day Laundry service - free and done for you , which is just great ! Location - whilst not the most central location , the host got us taxi ' s as we couldn ' t use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim ! We also used Google maps and the local bus , which is very cheap and reliable ! So I didn ' t find location as issue at all . My husband loved the free gym ! Whilst we did love our stay I feel it necessary to talk about what we didn ' t like . This place doesn ' t know what it wants yo be ! It ' s guests are mainly young English teachers who actually live there medium to long term , so it ' s their home ! We felt a bit like we were staying in their house . They are young , and with that came lots of night time noise , and socialising with friends not guests of the homestay right under our window until 2am on a couple of occasions . I expect young people to be noisy , it ' s normal , but I felt at the cost to other guests . This is because the place is mixed with different types of guests , and doesn ' t really have a true identity . This mixed with a very hard uncomfortable bed equaled a major lack of sleep for me ! However , we did still enjoy our booking , but I feel this feedback is necessary for mid age guests , where noise might be an issue . ####[['amazing use of space and a great meet and greet', 'facility', 'positive'], ['breakfast - excellent , very fresh and different each day', 'service', 'positive'], ['laundry service - free and done for you , which is just great', 'service', 'positive'], ['location - whilst not the most central location', 'amenity', 'neutral'], ["the host got us taxi ' s as we couldn ' t use the grab app as we only had a local electronic sim", 'service', 'positive'], ['my husband loved the free gym', 'facility', 'positive'], ['we did love our stay', 'experience', 'positive'], ['we did still enjoy our booking', 'experience', 'positive']]

Service and care from the front desk staff is EXCEPTIONAL , in addition to the good level of english they have . They are quick to respond to any concerns and queries guests have . I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel as one of the budget - friendly options in the island . They lock the front doors at night but the staff are easily contactable to open the door even at early hours of the morning . Maybe the hotel could switch to a passcode / keycard system for this as not to disturb the staff too much ? Food could also be a bit better but this is not too much of a drawback for the value you are getting from your stay . The location is also not the best as there is nothing too noteworthy in the immediate area , but Grab is easily accessible to downtown 10 minutes away .

275379,Very good location ; albeit being placed on a busy street , it was calm enough . The bed was very comfortable , and there was enough storage space in the room . There is a good basement for motorbike parking . Cheap shuttle ( taxi ) to the airport - half the price of Grab offer . Upon our arrival , the receptionist just gave us the key without any information about the hotel ( how to get to our room , what activities it offers etc . ) . In the room , there were writings on the wall , perhaps made by some kids in the past , the toilet seat was loose , the mirror cabinet was broken . There was a lot of dust behind and under the bed . The water temperature in the shower was always random , no matter what position one puts the handle to . In the mornings ( usually after 7 . 30 am ) , there were construction sounds heard from beyond the wall - there was no way to sleep through it .

Villa was spacious with 2 rooms and living hall . We asked about bike rental she immediately provided bike keys . Since there was a language barrier as soon as we call her she was coming near property I had messaged about arrival as it was not seen by owner , owner was not available near property when we arrived .

This meant that there was no fresh air , and the room was dark , hot and stuffy . Everything was moist and smelled like mould . Every morning we woke up with a headache and after a couple days started getting ill . Our clothes were constantly damp and smelly . Every evening we dreaded getting back to that room . Our toilet broke on the 3rd day and we were put in a different room for one night while they fixed it - that room was much nicer and didn ’ t smell , but the windows weren ’ t soundproof and we couldn ’ t sleep all night because of how loud it was . As we were pretty jet lagged we wanted to sleep in and left the Do Not Disturb sign on our door every morning , but every morning we were woken up by staff being loud outside our door . From around 7am to 11 there was always someone shouting , talking , making phone calls , hoovering etc , and we could hear everything like they were in our room . There were little ants everywhere . The shower door didn ’ t close . The room was cleaned every day but not very well .

When we reached there was nobody at the reception & just a phone no . Mentioned to call some one . Now imagine a person from outside country may not have calling accessibility then how will they call ? Our taxi driver helped us for the same . The staff ( lady ) was trying to be nice when we expressed our un likeness of the room & said we are giving you scooty rental in discount but later we came to know that she actually charged a higher amount from us then available outside . The breakfast was also very average , mostly bread was given & no butter . Only when asked it was provided . . . No eggs or anything . . we totally regret our decision to book this property .

273575,rien My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare . From the outset , the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous . The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic English . In a highly unprofessional move , he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking . com platform , promising “ better apartments , better views , and more check - in options . ” He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times ! And after reading reviews from previous guests , I discovered that those who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn ’ t get any of the promised benefits . The deceit didn ’ t stop there . On the check - in day , the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower . This was a complete bait and switch , and it left us feeling utterly duped . To add insult to injury , the apartment itself was a disaster . The furniture was old , worn , and filthy , and the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online . It was smaller , older , and lacked any charm or modern decoration . The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding . As if that weren ’ t enough , the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay . We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water . It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard . In short , our stay at Landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism . I urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere . It ’ s simply not worth the stress , frustration , and betrayal . ####[['my stay at landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous', 'service', 'neutral'], ['the person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic englis', 'service', 'negative'], ['in a highly unprofessional move , he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the booking . com platform , promising “ better apartments , better views , and more check - in options', 'service', 'negative'], ['he tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times !', 'service', 'negative'], ['who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn ’ t get any of the promised benefits', 'service', 'negative'], ['the deceit didn ’ t stop there', 'service', 'negative'], ['the owner switched our booking from the modern landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing landmark 1 tower', 'service', 'negative'], ['this was a complete bait and switch', 'service', 'negative'], ['it left us feeling utterly duped', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the apartment itself was a disaster', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the furniture was old , worn , and filthy', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online', 'branding', 'negative'], ['it was smaller , older , and lacked any charm or modern decoration .', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the ac unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay', 'facility', 'negative'], ['we had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water', 'facility', 'negative'], ['it was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard', 'experience', 'negative'], ['our stay at landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism', 'experience', 'negative'], ['i urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere', 'loyalty', 'negative'], ['it ’ s simply not worth the stress , frustration , and betrayal', 'experience', 'negative']]

One day we had 23 , 5 at the reception , the very next day they took us to different hotel and offered 22 , so we needed to argue / negotiate better deal . ####[['great view - room and bathroom were nice , clean and big enough', 'facility', 'positive'], ['not in the city center , so it was quiet during the evening / night and only 5 minutes walk to city center', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['they offer tickets to fansipan , buses', 'service', 'positive'], ['good breakfast', 'service', 'positive'], ['they prepared toasts to go for us', 'service', 'positive'], ['ac worked perfectly for both', 'facility', 'positive'], ['heating and cooling', 'facility', 'positive'], ['they offer a money exchange', 'service', 'positive']]

Location is good as it ’ s not located by the main road which can be noisy but it ’ s just right behind the main road and is walking distance to the beach . The breakfast is pretty decent and has everything for a wholesome breakfast . The wooden blinds in the bathroom was difficult to operate . The toiletries provided - shower cream , shampoo & conditioner could be better . The rattan interior also needs some fixing as the cabinet doors with rattan was damaged when we checked in . ####[['we like the design aesthetic of the hotel which gives a very authentic local vibes', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the garden view studio has a nice pair of lounge chairs with a small coffee table facing the outside garden', 'facility', 'positive'], ['we also loved the indoor koi fish pond which was full of giant koi fishes swimming around', 'facility', 'positive'], ['staff service is excellent and helpful', 'service', 'positive'], ['location is good as it ’ s not located by the main road which can be noisy but it ’ s just right behind the main road and is walking distance to the beach', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the breakfast is pretty decent and has everything for a wholesome breakfast', 'service', 'positive'], ['the wooden blinds in the bathroom was difficult to operate', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the toiletries provided - shower cream , shampoo & conditioner could be better', 'facility', 'neutral'], ['the rattan interior also needs some fixing as the cabinet doors with rattan was damaged when we checked in', 'facility', 'negative']]

The Mekong is truly a paradise of exotic fruit , vegetables and fish and the land market shows these off . The guests select the ingredients for the evening meal which is prepared by Tuan ' s family . An absolute feast ! Best of all is Tuan ' s hospitality . He makes sure that all is organized for a perfect stay including transportation to and from the airport / bus station , boat trip , local tour and delicious meals ( 3 a day for a nominal cost ) . He does this with warmth and humor . It was also a treat to socialize with the other guests . We had a fabulous time at Boutique Lodge with wonderful memories to treasure .

275113,I love the location of the homestay which is near to lots of attractions . With the free bicycles , we could reach those places easily . The owner or caretaker was also very friendly and helpful . Generous to check us in a few hours earlier and check us out one hour later . Always giving out free water bottles and helped us to book the limousine van back to Hanoi . The bed in the room looks like a super king size ! Shower was great too . Breakfast was good . Booking . com upgraded us to a room with three beds and lots of windows but we were given another room with only one bed and one window . Which was fine by us as we are only a couple but would love to have a corner lot unit for more sunlight . The room was a little musty upon entering but after airing it , it improved . ####[['i love the location of the homestay which is near to lots of attractions', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['free bicycles', 'service', 'positive'], ['the owner or caretaker was also very friendly and helpful', 'service', 'positive'], ['generous to check us in a few hours earlier and check us out one hour later', 'service', 'positive'], ['always giving out free water bottles', 'service', 'positive'], ['helped us to book the limousine van back to hanoi', 'service', 'positive'], ['the bed in the room looks like a super king size', 'facility', 'positive'], ['shower was great', 'facility', 'positive'], ['breakfast was good', 'service', 'positive'], ['booking . com upgraded us to a room with three beds and lots of windows but we were given another room with only one bed and one window', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the room was a little musty', 'facility', 'negative'], ['which was fine by us as we are only a couple but would love to have a corner lot unit for more sunlight', 'experience', 'neutral']]

275946,The location of the property was amazing . The room was nice and the bathroom as well . The breakfast had a wide range of options and was delicious . The staff only cared to inform us the pool , rooftop bar , and other facilities such as jacuzzi and sauna were closed due to maintenance after we paid for the room . We specifically chose this hotel for its facilities as the weather in Ho Chi Minh can be very hot . So , they should have informed us before we paid . They did offer another pool at Cochin Sang Hotel , which was 5 min away by foot . However , it was more like a bubble bath instead of a pool , and the inconvenience of having to walk to another hotel wasn ’ t worth it . Another thing worth mentioning is that we gave them our laundry . When we received it back , our socks were bleached and grew 2x in size . This meant that they were ruined and couldn ’ t be worn anymore . We did come to an agreement , in which the cost of the laundry was free and the taxi to the airport paid by the hotel , however , it did come with a lot of inconvenience as me and my partner were travelling more after Ho Chi Minh . ####[['the location of the property was amazing', 'amenity', 'positive'], ['the room was nice and the bathroom as well', 'facility', 'positive'], ['the breakfast had a wide range of options and was delicious', 'service', 'positive'], ['the staff only cared to inform us the pool , rooftop bar , and other facilities such as jacuzzi and sauna were closed due to maintenance after we paid for the room', 'service', 'negative'], ['we specifically chose this hotel for its facilities', 'experience', 'negative'], ['they should have informed us before we paid', 'experience', 'negative'], ['it was more like a bubble bath instead of a pool , and the inconvenience of having to walk to another hotel wasn ’ t worth it', 'experience', 'negative'], ['when we received it back , our socks were bleached and grew 2x in size', 'service', 'positive'], ['this meant that they were ruined and couldn ’ t be worn anymore', 'experience', 'negative'], ['we did come to an agreement , in which the cost of the laundry was free and the taxi to the airport paid by the hotel', 'experience', 'positive'], ['it did come with a lot of inconvenience as me and my partner were travelling more after ho chi minh', 'experience', 'negative']]

273916,Simply everything was great ! The stay with Phoung , the owner , and his family was the best part during my entire scooter ride trip through Vietnam . Phoung and his lovely wife took so well care of me , they treat their guests literally like family . I initially wanted to stay only one night as a stop over coming from Sapa , heading to Hanoi . However I liked it so much instantly , that I decided to stay 2 nights . The freshly cooked breakfast and dinner , eaten together with the family , was the best meals I have had in Vietnam . Phoung brought me on a boat trip on Thac Ba Lake , which was amazing . In the evening he brought me and one other guest from India to play volleyball and dance together with his wife and her friends in the village .

In The evening they have a band playing in the sky bar which is nice and jolly . The food choice at the rooftop pool and bar area is very disappointing and it ’ s expensive . However I would recommend the steakhouse . The service is pretty slow at reception I waited seven hours for them to fix my phone in my room . Had to call off my mobile phone several times to remind them and the air con wasn ’ t working and as no one turned up I ended up having to go down stairs in my pjs to ask for someone to come up . I stayed there this time last year and the service was much better so it ’ s definitely gone downhill . I spoke to the manager about it and they did let me extend my checkout time for free as compensation .

The guesthouse is well located and there are lots of nice shops , little coffee shops , bars and restaurants nearby . Not too far from the night market , maybe 10 minutes by foot . It ' s great value for money ! The bathroom was connected to the one next door and so we could hear everything that the guests next door were saying . It ' s worth noting that two of the dogs are very friendly and like being petted , but two of them are not . We observed them snapping at / biting several other guests who went to touch them a couple of times . We absolutely love dogs but were a little bit concerned to see this . ####[['the staff are so friendly and helpful . they really want to help you make the most of da lat and have lots of helpful suggestions', 'service', 'positive'], ['the included breakfast is tasty , with several choices , and you are welcome to more , which is nice', 'service', 'positive'], ['the room was a nice size and had everything we needed', 'facility', 'positive'], ["there was no ac but the room had a fan , and as da lat is so cool at night , you didn ' t miss ac", 'facility', 'neutral'], ['the guesthouse is well located and there are lots of nice shops , little coffee shops , bars and restaurants nearby . not too far from the night market , maybe 10 minutes by foot', 'amenity', 'positive'], ["it ' s great value for money", 'experience', 'positive'], ['the bathroom was connected to the one next door and so we could hear everything that the guests next door were saying', 'facility', 'negative']]

270540,Very well maintained resort with helpful staff . The rooms in the Villa part are big and very comfortable , especially those on eth first floor , where we stayed . There are two pools and both are great place to relax after your day trips or instead of a day trip . Our friends spent some time on the beach area that is managed by the hotel and were pleased with everything there . The hotel provides free bikes . Breakfast is not varied and of average quality . The resort needs to make and effort to bring it to the rest of the experience . I knew that the resort is not close to the center but it turned to be much further than I imagined because it is impossible to get in a straight line to the old town due to the way Vietnamese cities are planned , or rather never planned at all . ####[['very well maintained resort with helpful staff', 'service', 'positive'], ['the rooms in the villa part are big and very comfortable , especially those on eth first floor , where we stayed . there are two pools and both are great place to relax after your day trips or instead of a day trip', 'facility', 'positive'], ['breakfast is not varied and of average quality', 'service', 'neutral'], ['i knew that the resort is not close to the center but it turned to be much further than i imagined', 'branding', 'negative']]

The staff was nice and kind . We forgot a jacket and they contacted us to ship it back . Because the place surrounded by nature , there are quite many forest creatures around ( bugs , ants , … ) . Also , the washroom cleanliness could be better . One of the rooms I stayed in has the humid smell . The bathroom entrance in one room was right opposite the bed ( few steps aways ) with no entrance door . Smell from the washroom could get to the room quite easy .

276033,Zizi was an amazing tour guide ! She was very kind and knowledgable - we felt safe with Zizi . For example , one of our members starting to throw up during the trek and unfortunately was unable to continue . Kindly , Zizi organized for a taxi to take this member back to the homestay where they could rest . The homestay accommodation was gorgeous and is actually one of the few ran by locals . The view from the room was amazing - rice field upon rice field . The beds were extremely comfortable and we were provided with mosquito nets . The food was incredible , some of the best we ’ ve eaten in Vietnam ( so fresh ) . The trek itself was great too got to see a lot of ethnic minority villages and on the second day walk through a bamboo forest and to a waterfall . We felt the trek was perhaps slightly of a more advanced level than we originally thought . We ( three 21 year old students ) found it quite challenging at times and there was not a lot of smooth paths to walk on . We feel this is important to mention as older people or people with perhaps sustained i juried may find this difficult !

272386,Good location , good happy hours and comfy beds . This hotel claims to be the first 5 * in Hanoi and even though the price tag is there , I don ’ t think the hotel is yet . The hotel itself is beautiful , especially the main lobby area but our room was very underwhelming . We stayed in room 301 which was between some sort of staff room and the staff only elevator so there was a lot of noise from 7am onwards . There was also a lot of maintenance work going on on Monday 10 / 04 which had us up very early ( sounded like drilling ) . Our toilet and shower cubicles both had mould around the floor tiles too ! We used the facilities on the roof top , both the pool and the bar and these weren ’ t at a 5 * standard either . The pool is really small and there are only 8 loungers which are super close together . Despite them being full , no staff offered us the lounge cushions which I found inside near the sauna but they were very quick and pushy about us ordering drinks whilst we were using the facilities . The bar has a good happy hour but it was a good 15 / 20 minute wait per drink . The drinks themselves were excellent though and they make a top notch Negroni ! I think they need to make a couple of tweaks to get this place up to standard and it definitely could be there with some changes but as it currently is , there are more affordable and equally nice hotels around the old town . ####[['this hotel claims to be the first 5 * in hanoi and even though the price tag is there , i don ’ t think the hotel is yet', 'branding', 'neutral'], ['the hotel itself is beautiful , especially the main lobby area', 'facility', 'positive'], ['but our room was very underwhelming . we stayed in room 301 which was between some sort of staff room and the staff only elevator so there was a lot of noise from 7am onwards', 'facility', 'negative'], ['there was also a lot of maintenance work going on on monday 10 / 04 which had us up very early', 'experience', 'negative'], ['our toilet and shower cubicles both had mould around the floor tiles too', 'facility', 'negative'], ['we used the facilities on the roof top , both the pool and the bar and these weren ’ t at a 5 * standard either', 'facility', 'negative'], ['the pool is really small and there are only 8 loungers which are super close together', 'facility', 'negative'], ['despite them being full , no staff offered us the lounge cushions which i found inside near the sauna but they were very quick and pushy about us ordering drinks whilst we were using the facilities', 'service', 'negative'], ['the bar has a good happy hour but it was a good 15 / 20 minute wait per drink', 'experience', 'negative'], ['the drinks themselves were excellent though and they make a top notch negroni', 'service', 'positive'], ['there are more affordable and equally nice hotels around the old town', 'branding', 'negative']]

Thanks to Hannah ' s support , I had an incredible travel experience without any issues . I am genuinely satisfied with my stay and cannot wait to return .

270390,The resort was phenomenal !!! This was my first time visiting Vietnam with my family and after traveling from north to south , we were exhausted . At first I had booked another hotel in Phu Quoc but after reading the reviews , I canceled and booked Andochine instead . It was more $$$ but well worth it . It was a “ mini vacation ” within my tiring vacation . The villa had a private pool right on the beachfront . The beach was beautiful but the waves were too strong - so it was dangerous to swim . Good thing we had the private pool all to ourselves . My family really enjoyed the much needed relaxation . The bedrooms and bathrooms were very very clean . The beds were very comfortable . The basement also had a billiard room and a poker room . Overall my family had an excellent and relaxing time at Andochine Villas - we strongly recommend this resort ( if you could splurge it :) Nothing ####[['the villa had a private pool right on the beachfront', 'facility', 'positive'], ['good thing we had the private pool all to ourselves . my family really enjoyed the much needed relaxation', 'experience', 'positive'], ['the bedrooms and bathrooms were very very clean . the beds were very comfortable . the basement also had a billiard room and a poker room', 'facility', 'positive'], ['my family had an excellent and relaxing time at andochine villas', 'experience', 'positive'], ['we strongly recommend this resort', 'loyalty', 'positive'], ['the resort was phenomenal', 'facility', 'positive']]
