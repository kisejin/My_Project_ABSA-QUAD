482,The location of this hotel is great, in the Old Town and walking distance to many attractions. The staff were extremely friendly and very helpful, they wanted to help and arrange a room for us to shower when we returned from Halong and waited for the car. Jim was really kind when he always smiled and took care of us, he helped us carry our laundry up to our room and gave us a beautiful card. The room is comfortable and quiet.

138719,No breakfast, room had not been cleaned for three days. Awful smell in bathroom. We had to go and ask for clean towels . No fan or air conditioner in room. Shower, water did not run properly. Third morning, shower water was cold. Everything could be better. The name of this hotel is not the White House delux but the White House. Driver spent over half an hour trying to find this hotel because incorrect name. When we finally ascertained that the White House was the hotel that we booked, driver paid the staff out asking why was it called the White House delux, staff just laughed. Staff could not speak any english. Communication was poor. Often there was no one at reception. We booked a bus through reception for nha trang and were told it was going to leave at 8. 30am. We were told we could pay with credit card on leaving. We were told in four different times that the bus would leave at 8. 30am. In the morning when we were leaving we could not have a shower because the water was cold. When we got to reception at 7. 15am we were told that the bus was leaving at 7. 40 am. Then we were told that we had to pay the hotel and bus fare in cash. After finalising the bill the staff grabbed our bags and took off from the hotel and said we had to hurry for the bus. He then disappeared into the street somewhere with our bags. We could not see him anywhere. Finally we saw him up the road dragging our bags. Eventually we got to the bus and an argument between the driver and staff because we were late. When we arrived in nha trang we had notification from booking. com that we had stayed for two days instead of the three days that we had booked. We contacted booking. com who sorted this issue quickly. This hotel and staff appears to be dishonest.

1364,The sea is right in front of the resort, and it's a very quiet place to stay, so if those things appeal to you, I highly recommend it. My room's wifi was not working properly. The air conditioner did not cool the room sufficiently, so it was extremely hot, and water was leaking through the AC evaporator. The staff was pleasant and helpful, but communication was occasionally difficult due to their limited English level. For example, when I was in the taxi, the driver asked them in "Vietnamese" if I could exchange money in the hotel, because I live in Korea and had korean wons, and they said yes no problem, but when I arrived, they said I had to go to Saigon (mainland Vietnam) because they don't exchange korean won in Phu quoc, which I could had already done if I had known this.

The homestay's owners were exceptionally helpful, flexible, and willing to help with anything we needed when we were staying there.

We weren't told that the pool would be closed for renovations and if I had been advised of this before/leading up to our stay then I would have chosen to stay at a different hotel as we really wanted to have a hotel with a pool especially when we were travelling during a really hot time in HCMC (35 degrees Celcius or higher).

1863,Very modern and comfortable with great spa bath if you wish, nice big TV with Netflix, look there is no breakfast but it is a great area with loads of fantastic cheap eaterys close by, cheap as Banh mi which is a great breakfast staple. Nice lake at the end of the street with great coffee shops on the opposite side. Great to support the local venues and get away from the touristy hot spots. I thoroughly recommend this hotel and can't believe it isn't at least 4 stars. It is a little away from the main area but if you don't mind riding a scooter and really getting lost in the city and realising how much that has to offer or catching a grab taxi it is really worth while.

1042,We did an extensive review (in person as well) of all the hotels in the area and I would say this one is the best one. The design of the hotel is super nice, with a very warm and crafty feeling! The views are absolutely gorgeous. The rooms are big and comfortable. I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics. The room was clean, bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white. The maintenance of the hotel is not the best, which is a real pity, because it was designed so nicely. When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage. The hot water is very inconsistent when showering, sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself! Some staff is nice, others not so much. I think the language barrier is the biggest problem because almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude, which I don't think it's their intention. I would suggest the management trains the people a bit better. ####[['The design of the hotel is super nice, with a very warm and crafty feeling', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' The views are absolutely gorgeous', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The rooms are big and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I really appreciated all the handcrafted details like embroidery or handmade ceramics', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room was clean, bed sheets and towels were fresh and crisp white', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The maintenance of the hotel is not the best, which is a real pity, because it was designed so nicely', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['When there is heavy rain there can be water leakage.', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The hot water is very inconsistent when showering, sometimes it gets so hot very quickly that you can burn yourself', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' Some staff is nice', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['almost none speak English well and they can be perceived as rude', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' I think the language barrier is the biggest problem', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['I would suggest the management trains the people a bit better', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], [' all the hotels in the area and I would say this one is the best one', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

138765,The resort was phenomenal!!! This was my first time visiting Vietnam with my family and after traveling from north to south, we were exhausted. At first I had booked another hotel in Phu Quoc but after reading the reviews, I canceled and booked Andochine instead. It was more $$$ but well worth it. It was a “mini vacation” within my tiring vacation. The villa had a private pool right on the beachfront. The beach was beautiful but the waves were too strong - so it was dangerous to swim. Good thing we had the private pool all to ourselves. My family really enjoyed the much needed relaxation. The bedrooms and bathrooms were very very clean. The beds were very comfortable. The basement also had a billiard room and a poker room.

1029,Our stay at Azerai was great. The staff were friendly and super attentive, and the facilities were nice and new. From the moment we were picked up, we were very well taken care of. One minor issue of an old razor being found in our room was made up for with a room upgrade. Food in the restaurant was good, albeit a little pricey but options in Can Tho were easy to access. The staff were great in recommending various places to visit. The highlight of the trip were our excursions on the wooden boat and the full day guided village tour where we got to eat locally grown fruits and we were lucky enough to spend a couple of hours in a local’s house while we waited for the rain to pass. Everything was super genuine and authentic - The guide, also a resort employee, grew up in that very isolated and local neighbourhood and made the experience amazing! Lastly the hotel transfer from Ho Chi Minh City was excellent - a comfortable limousine van which made the two hour trip each way enjoyable. Would recommend to visit, and stay in the Lake rooms.

I had so much fun there I barely left the hotel. This place makes other 5 star places look like 2 star. I had a room on 36 level so if you don’t like heights let them know when you book. the price is reasonable for what they offer.

I found her texts to be increasingly bizarre and late at night. She then told me she had a sick child and needed my help. She then offered to buy me a drink in Hanoi if I would just accept her plan to use the cheaper room. She was concerned about her job and realised she had made a big mistake. I was paying a lot of money for this cruise and did not want to move rooms. I told her it was her problem and she would have to fix it.

127,The location next to night market is great. The rooms are clean and big However we had issues with the laundry. Half of our laundry became yellow tainted with red/dark stains. When we addressed it, the host didn't take responsibility and blamed the outsourced laundry worker. That lead to lot of discussion with that person (about sunscreen making the yellow stains, but there were more on the clothes after than before it). In the end, we still had to pay for everything and half our clothes are ruined.

We spent two days comfortably cycling around the area, including Mua Cave and Trang An. Lily offers discounted prices on spa treatments. There are some wonderful options for eating, drinking coffee and enjoying a beer all within walking distance.

138879,It really was a great hideaway and base for exploring Ben Tre. It is located on the quieter side of the river and way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel. The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area. The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more. The homestay itself is cute and homely, with a small shared living space that you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions. The rooms are located just behind a little stream at the back and provides total quietness. Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them! We stayed at the triangle shaped room and loved our view. Internet is great and we enjoyed our daily coconuts that came from right from the tree beside us. It was such a lovely place to get away from HCMC for a few days. It is a great value for price! The only inconvenience (that can be easily rectified) is that as it is in the outskirt of Ben Tre you cannot reach there by public transport from HCMC. The small taxi rides are absolutely worth being in the quietness and lush green surroundings! ####[['It is located on the quieter side of the river', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['way better than staying on the city side as it is quieter and has more of a village feel', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The homestay provides free bikes and it was easy to get around on small side roads and explore the area', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The city is a quick 10 min bike ride away shall you need anything more', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The homestay itself is cute and homely, with a small shared living space', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['you can order dinner from and reach the friendly receptionists for any questions', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Each room is uniquely themed so be sure to look at all of them!

138437,This was our best accomodation in Vietnam. There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses. There are small pools with fish and water flowers, it is like in a fairy-tale. I really recommend the place. Our bathroom was in the back of the house, outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle. Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also. We arrived in february and the weather was perfect. Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area. This is perfect for nature lovers. The room itself was clean and spacious. Clean towels and linen. The young ladies at the reception are welkoming and very helpful with everything you need. They organised transportation, help with motorcicle or motorbike rental, offer info and help with everything. They are very kind. They organised us the boat tour to floating market and arranged us the transportation to their places and then to the airport in Can Tho based on our group needs. Excellent comunication with them. The place is in the rural area near Can Tho so it is interesting to explore the villages by bicicle and see how people live, make an idea of how the life in around water canals. There is a local-style minimarket at walking distance from the accomodation. If you dont ride bicicle or motorbike the area might look a bit remote. We found no other place to eat at walking distance but we reached a small town at 6 km of bicicle ride with the help of google maps where you can find everything. We bought some exotic interesting fruits there in the fruit market and brought them at the accomodation and enjoyed them in the eating area. The boat tour on the canals and at the floating market revealed a lot of pollution. Plastic waste floating everywhere. It is very sad to see that. Otherwise it is interesting to see the trade at the floating market. ####[['This was our best accomodation in Vietnam', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There are lot of flowers and well maintained vegetation around the houses', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There are small pools with fish and water flowers, it is like in a fairy-tale', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I really recommend the place', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our bathroom was in the back of the house, outside area but with a tall fence for perfect privacy and a green corner so it makes you feel like your private space in the jungle', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Maybe inconvenient in chilly months but I undersrood some houses have inside bathroom also', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Occasionally some birds came in the bathroom space to argue if the small furniture above the sink is a good place for nesting and some little insects find their way to the shower area.

139544,I stayed more than a week and wow, the service of the staff all the way from Mary the general manager, to Eric and the others at the front desk was super and exceeded my expectations. It was Ritz Carlton level service. Breakfast was perfect, delicious and so many options, they also have an espresso machine but that’s extra (regular coffee and tea is free). There is such kind staff in the breakfast, so attentive to be sure the guests are comfortable and happy. My bed and pillows were so comfortable (standard double room) and a really nice marble shower. I did not have a window but i wouldn’t have opened it bc the a/c was on and i wouldn’t want to let mosquitos in. The room did not need a window, it felt very open and nice and very sweetly furnished — the designer of the hotel had very good taste. Especially the huge fuchsia colored chandelier in the lobby! I feel it’s important to allow guests to fill up water bottles with the hotel’s purified water so guests do not use plastic bottles and add to environmental plastic waste for sweet vietnam ####[[' the service of the staff all the way from Mary the general manager, to Eric and the others at the front desk was super and exceeded my expectations', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast was perfect, delicious and so many options, they also have an espresso machine but that’s extra ', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There is such kind staff in the breakfast, so attentive to be sure the guests are comfortable and happy', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['My bed and pillows were so comfortable (standard double room) and a really nice marble shower', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' I did not have a window but i wouldn’t have opened it bc the a/c was on and i wouldn’t want to let mosquitos in', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], [' The room did not need a window, it felt very open and nice and very sweetly furnished', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' the designer of the hotel had very good taste', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Especially the huge fuchsia colored chandelier in the lobby', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I feel it’s important to allow guests to fill up water bottles with the hotel’s purified water so guests do not use plastic bottles and add to environmental plastic waste for sweet vietnam', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

The room was extremely dark as our window looked out onto a wall and a roof top with broken air conditioner units on.

They took the dirty towels away without replacing new ones. I had to constantly ask house keeping to replace our towels. The room was dusty and there were lots of small insects in the room. No counter space in the bathroom to leave toiletries. Limited hanging space/hooks to hang wet towels. Very poor for a family room.

138483,For our wedding anniversary celebration, my family decided to stay at this lovely resort called Memorina. And wow, did it surpass our expectations! Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery, it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape. The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat, bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region. We spent hours wandering around the resort, discovering charming nooks, admiring the vibrant plant life, and even giving fishing a shot. One of the highlights was visiting the sheepfold – an experience that not only captivated us but also filled our kids with wide-eyed wonder. Watching their faces light up as they interacted with the sheep was absolutely heartwarming. During our stay, we were treated to a gentle evening rain, which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand. All in all, our time at Memorina etched a truly special memory in our family's journey. ####[[' We spent hours wandering around the resort, discovering charming nooks, admiring the vibrant plant life, and even giving fishing a shot', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, always ready to assist whenever we needed a hand', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it surpass our expectations', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Tucked away in a serene setting surrounded by lush greenery', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['it provided the perfect backdrop for an unforgettable escape', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' The local Vietnamese cuisine was a real treat', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['bursting with flavors that genuinely captured the essence of the region', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['During our stay, we were treated to a gentle evening rain, which added a touch of enchantment to the whole experience', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["our time at Memorina etched a truly special memory in our family's journey", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

There is a lift to ground floor but you then need to go down another 2 set of stairs to get to the pool. Not good for people in wheelchairs or with mobility issues. I ended up having to go outside and walk down driveway to get to pool. Repeatedly asked to get mini fridge replaced in one room but they had no idea. Kept saying yes and everyday it still didn't work. Gave up after 3 days. The breakfast was quite good. Had a variety of food for buffet and even on the day they did a la carte there was a good choice. Only a 10 min walk to night market. The pool looked nice and the kids enjoyed it. They do supply a towel for swimming. They need more people that can understand English at the front desk. Not sure I would use it again but it was fairly cheap. The ground floor was in construction and nothing down there, just empty rooms. Reception was on 1st floor.

489,Service was very good. The staff was really nice. I asked for a room with high floor, nice view and without neighbours and I got it. I also got a late checking and a heater because it's really cold in Ha Noi these day. I felt warm and comfy. I am very happy I stayed there.

831,Pool area was really nice, rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable. I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer. Staff very friendly. After ordering a sandwich the bar tender took my payment card away to reception, I presumed to bring a card machine or to swipe my card at reception. There was some misunderstanding and I thought he was asking for my room number but sometime later I got a failed chip and pin attempt notification, he had exceeded the amount of pin attempts and my card was permanently blocked! After several correspondence with my bank about how to unblock it I found out that: The card can only be unblocked in the U. K. For the rest of the trip I was unable to use my card!He probably was trying to provide extra service and be helpful, or maybe it is a cultural difference but in the U. K. no one would ever give their PIN number to someone else, especially a staff member or stranger so we would never even suspect that a member of hotel staff was asking for a PIN number and not a room number. I was annoyed to say the least and even asked them to remove the service charge. At the end they still kept the charge on and I even added somesmall tip because felt bad for the guy who made a mistake, he did also give me a complimentary cola. Though if this happened in Europe at a luxury hotel or resort the sandwich would have lest been complimented in full. Be very careful and never let anyone walk away with your card! I was also fortunate that I had another card still within free withdrawal limits for the trip. ####[['Pool area was really nice, rooms had a nice beach style design theme and where very comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I had a look at the window room and also the standard superior one and personally thought the standard room with sky light was nicer', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Staff very friendly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

The location is not too far from the city center, we can walk to the city to visit the bridge at night. There are a lot of good restaurant in that area.

The room (double room with private bathroom) was EXTREMELY noisy - and this is coming someone who isn't very sensitive to noise/can sleep almost everywhere. I understand it's impossible for it to be completely quiet as the room faces the street and is opposite a school but better windows really need to be installed or, at the very least, thicker velvet curtains that would keep the sound out. On top of that, there was a hole in the upper pane of balcony doors. I didn't mind this so much but I know this is important to some people - the water pressure in the shower is weak. ####[['The room itself was very spacious - seating area with sofa, bed, dining table, pantry area, bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Basic toiletries and towels were provided', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Location was good - lots of food options and cafes around, not too far from the heart of D1', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Internet was reliable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['was EXTREMELY noisy', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['windows really need to be installed or, at the very least, thicker velvet curtains that would keep the sound out', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['there was a hole in the upper pane of balcony doors', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the water pressure in the shower is weak', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' the room faces the street and is opposite a school', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

She also helped arrange bikes and motorbikes for us to borrow to travel to the city center and helped troubleshoot problems when needed. Overall, we were very impressed with the hospitality. We arrived by car from Da Nang and had some trouble navigating since the alley to this place was very narrow, but there was some parking space in front of the villa itself so it wasn't a problem. You will need transportation to get to the city center that is around 4km away (free bikes, motorbikes, car - bit difficult considering the alley, or taxis and other options).Some electric sockets were not working and the lighting of the whole place was very dim - to fit the vibe.

417,We were received by Mr. Danh and his wife, who both run this motel. Such a warm and friendly welcome! They even texted us before our arrival to check if we had any trouble locating the property. We were doing a motorcycle trip in Vietnam, and were riding from Hue to Hoi An. Decided to stop by Canh Duong Motel for a night's rest. Motel is easy to locate on Google Maps, situated next to a beach with PLENTY of seafood restaurants to choose from. Mr Danh is very friendly and an excellent host - he also speaks good English so communication was no problem. Mr Danh actually lives in the community, so he provided great guide to the local eateries and roads which was useful for us. Our room had very clean and shiny tiled floors, large bathroom with great water pressure and heated water. Air-conditioning worked very well. Many reviews highlighted the firm bed, but it is actually firm yet comfortable! Power socket points were convenient. Accomodation was perfect! Thank you Mr Danh! ####[['Such a warm and friendly welcome', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They even texted us before our arrival to check if we had any trouble locating the property', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Motel is easy to locate on Google Maps, situated next to a beach with PLENTY of seafood restaurants to choose from', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Mr Danh is very friendly and an excellent host - he also speaks good English so communication was no problem', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Mr Danh actually lives in the community, so he provided great guide to the local eateries and roads which was useful for us', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our room had very clean and shiny tiled floors', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' large bathroom with great water pressure and heated water', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Air-conditioning worked very well', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Power socket points were convenient', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Many reviews highlighted the firm bed, but it is actually firm yet comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Accomodation was perfect', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

1188,Great Homestay in the City Center, with many restaurants, food stalls, bars, coffee places, etc. right next to it. The owner is super friendly and very helpful. We were able to purchase the DMZ tour from her, she prepared breakfast before the tour as it started early in the morning as well before our super early flight from Hue airport. She also organized the transport to the airport. The room was very spacious and clean, and so was the bathroom. Water pressure was the best we encountered in Vietnam. Comfortable big bed, great working fridge, and wifi. I would definitely recommend.

Also the close proximity to the airport and free shuttle service for our departure was excellent.

Also there was no option to order meals/drinks at lunch time at the pool; as the staff did not start until 4pm. Again I went down to the restaurant in the lobby to ask about getting a meal & drinks sent up to the pool. I was told the only way we could do this was to order room service and take it up to the pool. So we had to return to our room, order our meal then return to the pool. In that time our towels had been removed so had to go get more towels. All this inconvenience could have been fix with either one staff member in attendance at the pool during the day or a telephone at the pool bar with instructions to call & order meals/drinks over the phone.

139759,Ideally located (10 minutes walk from Van Long nature reserve - however see negative comments below), exceptionally beautiful and well maintained grounds, excellent breakfast and the dining menu at the restaurant was very good. Rooms are more like private bungalows and were clean and comfortable. The resort, despite it's beautiful trimmings is not good value money - it's actually a greedy money grab. One particular incident left a very sour note for us. The Van Long nature reserve is literally 10 minutes walk away and the normal booking price at the ticketing office for a boatman is 70k per boat. The resort charged us over 200k per person for this "tour" for which all they did was save us the walk by dropping us with their golf cart. Their golf cart driver literally paid the ticketing office the basic fee and dropped us then came back it pick us up. So essentially we paid for the convenience of a 5 minute golf cart ride. I find this extremely greedy. A resort of this of this size should upfront be offering this information and/or even providing this drop off service for free to guests.

140115,the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish, the owner and the staff generally polite, friendly and helpful. i was offered free tea during check-in and check-out. good communication via whatsapp, the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in. on arrival my scooter was brought to a safe place and they also took care of my keys and gear. Unfortunately there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds. On arrival I was warned of the nocturnal noise from the street - to be fair, before paying. However, the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs, even the mattress vibrated (and that was on the 4th floor, not directly at the street and on a tuesday) - not the hotels fault, but guests should be aware of this. After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff, they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel (30k) saying it couldn't be reused anymore (!). after i asked if it's possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away, they wanted to bill me for 200k. I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet. i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules. ####[['the hotel itself is nice and my room was clean and stylish', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' the owner and the staff generally polite, friendly and helpful', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['i was offered free tea during check-in and check-out', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['good communication via whatsapp, the owner helped me with some questions about the weather in hanoi because i got stuck in the rain with my scooter 3 hours away from hanoi the day i checked in', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' there was only a window to the hallway in the room whose light falls directly on the bed all night long despite the blinds', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the noise on the street and the music in the hotel is so loud that it was not possible to sleep even with earplugs', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["After I left the room clean and put my rubbish in a plastic bag to make it easy for the staff, they wanted to charge me for a used tiny towel (30k) saying it couldn't be reused anymore ", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [" i asked if it's possible to keep it if i pay the 30k and before they throw it away, they wanted to bill me for 200k", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' I felt as if someone just wanted to take the money out of my wallet', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['i think there are worse guests like me and the hotel should rethink the rules', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

I kindly ask Sandy at reception if there is any place where I could change 20-30USD. She said (and that was not true) that it is Sunday so everything is closed. She offered me really bad exchange rate (quite worse then the one I got at Intecontinental a day before) and once more confirmed I can not exchange it outside. After that (lie) i went out and after 1min walk saw that there are many touristic small agencies where you can exchange money with quite better rate. I was really dissappinted because it a small cheating which simply makes all worse than it might be. So don't cheat that way - it is not ok. I came back and said that at reception.

139112,We purposely chose Sapa Clayhouse as the finale of our Vietnam trip and it was such a treat for us. We booked the executive suite. Everything inside the room was perfect. We went in mid December their winter season, and we were pleasantly surprised that the bed was heated. The decor and furnishings of the entire place were tastefully done up too, so pretty that we requested to buy some vases as souvenirs. The staffs were all very professional and polite. Food was really good too, everything we ordered was a hit. And try their signature house cocktail mix it was so good! Highly highly highly recommend to make this place your last stop in Sapa. We were a little shocked that the housekeeping team actually went into our room to clean up while we were at the dining area having our meal. It was a nice and attentive gesture but would appreciate the option for us to choose if we want the service or not, as for our personal preference, we prefer not to have housekeeping service during our stay to prevent any mishaps. But overall the stay totally exceeded my expectations I highly recommend it. ####[['We purposely chose Sapa Clayhouse as the finale of our Vietnam trip and it was such a treat for us', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Everything inside the room was perfect', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we were pleasantly surprised that the bed was heated', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' The decor and furnishings of the entire place were tastefully done up too', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The staffs were all very professional and polite', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Food was really good too, everything we ordered was a hit', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Highly highly highly recommend to make this place your last stop in Sapa', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' We were a little shocked that the housekeeping team actually went into our room to clean up while we were at the dining area having our meal.

I understand that the resort is situated far away from supermarkets etc, but I found the cost of the food and drinks very high. When we checked in our bags were not taken to our room. We had to go to reception and ask where they were. Would be nice if there was some hiking(besides the walk up the stream) Only once we booked we found out that children are allowed at the resort.

140080,The location of the hotel is excellent. Although It is only away from the "Hồ Hoàn Kiếm" (Lake) only 3 streets, the hotel is not noisy. One of the best things is the service and hospitality. When we arrived to the hotel and ready to check-in, the front-desk staff served us with pineapple ginseng tea and sweets. The whole check-in process was very smoothly and in-order. Another advantage is the breakfast, every morning we enjoyed very good breakfast with many choice (Western, French, Vietnamese), The staff always show very polite and friendly hospitality. We often spent over one hour to having breakfast in the restaurant. The quality of the room is excellent, Although my room was not very large, it is very clear and provided with drinks, coffee and tea bags and fruits. During the Lunar new year holiday, Hotel celebrated the new year with the Red packet and biscuits! Also, we could book the transportation to the airport, all payment can be settled in the front-desk. The price is fair. The staff could confirm everything with us the date before our departure.

The cruise was not busy and so we had the chance to be upgraded to their best suite, for free! Views were absolutely incredible from that room. The food in the evening is also good, attention to the details was appreciated. Highly recommend this company, as it is one of our highlights of our trip.

139770,We really enjoyed our stay and it was mostly due to the exceptional hospitality of the staff and the entire family. We felt well taken care of, as if we were part of the family. All our requests were addressed, our rooms were very good and we could choose the rooms that most met our expectations. The cleaning service was very good, our towels were changed daily, rooms were cleaned and the water supplied daily. We could use bikes to reach Old Town, but you can easily walk there and enjoy this part of Hoi An as much as you wish. The pool was ok. not too big though but it was refreshing to be able to use it after our short trips. It was very hot during our stay and the pool was a blessing.

We asked to be transfered to another room and they did. The next room was okay but I woke up in the middle of the night smelling molds again. I hope they will make some updates of the building. Second, the breakfast is okay but a bit limited. Lastly, we felt that the ladies at the reception are intrusive. For example, the moment we arrived, we just want a rest as we were tired but she was selling us many many things like tours or tailors and repeat many unnecessary information which was annoying for us. They keep asking questions like who is your taxi driver, where are you going, which store?..

Good advice would be to not book too early and check the weather...better to go sooner while the weather is tame than to be pushed for time and have to cancel some things. Luckily for us, we had time. The location is great and we used this hotel as a base as we did 1-3 day trips around Hanoi. They were great with communication and super accommodating. Highly recommend as a good accomodation for the cost. Hotel construction started at 7:30-11am and we weren't warnded/informed. They were very apologetic about it and we are totally understanding as they have to do it at some point. It would just be considerate to let guests know beforehand (and I have given this same feedback on their checkout form).Still, the room is nice and I would come back to stay here!

1580,The room was comfortable and clean, and the pool was very nice (apart from the rubbish at the bottom). It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi’s are available to get into town. The cleaning staff were very friendly. The staff weren’t helpful - there is a clear lack of management. The pool bar wait times are ridiculous, 1. 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water, 1. 5 for food as well. On our first 2 days the wait wasn’t as bad but there was only one person, the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long. The food and drink is also very overpriced (western prices) and very average. The laundry service is ridiculously expensive, we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear! There is no local advice available from the staff. We weren’t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren’t offered the welcome drink they advertise. Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment. The breakfast is constantly running out, and even if all the food and drink is available, there are no cups or plates to use! The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover, there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it. Overall, this is a 3 star experience, but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it’s a good option. ####[['The room was comfortable and clean, and the pool was very nice ', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' It was nice being near the beach and Grab taxi’s are available to get into town', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The cleaning staff were very friendly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The staff weren’t helpful - there is a clear lack of management', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The pool bar wait times are ridiculous', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['1. 5 hours for an orange juice and bottle of water, 1. 5 for food as well', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['On our first 2 days the wait wasn’t as bad but there was only one person, the second and third there were two people and they were taking far too long', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' The laundry service is ridiculously expensive, we went to a local laundrette and paid the same amount for 1kg of clothes as the hotel were going to charge for 1 piece of underwear', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The food and drink is also very overpriced', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['and very average', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['There is no local advice available from the staff', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We weren’t able to get into our room until 30 minutes after the check in time and weren’t offered the welcome drink they advertise', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The breakfast is constantly running out, and even if all the food and drink is available, there are no cups or plates to use', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Most of the hotel is derelict and in need of refurbishment', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The pool is in desperate need of an underwater hoover, there is a lot of debris on the bottom of it', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['this is a 3 star experience, but if you want a comfortable room with a big pool and near a beach it’s a good option', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

The resort was so quiet during the day, super relaxing! Our only negative was at no fault to Cassia Cottage, but was the noise coming from neighbouring resorts and bars who blasted their music on the beach every night from sunset. It did unfortunately ruin the quiet laid back vibe of Cassia Cottage in the evening.

139250,The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture. There were ample electrical socketss. The bathroom and plumbing was quite good. The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy. There was plenty of parking near the gate. There was easy access to a lovely clean beach, direct from the resort. There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures. it was surrounded by trees giving ample shade to the loungers. The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view. There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure, Napoli being the best. We have used this one many times in the past. There are some small local shops ( kiosks) for basic needs. The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer. Not much! Like a lot of the resorts here, they suffer from a lack of customers during covid so have an air of being a bit run-down. However the faults were minor and did not detract from our stay. The restaurant only had a partial service due to lack of customers. There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning, when the resort filled up for the weekend. At other times there was a limited menu. There wasn't anywhere to hang wet clothes after, say, a swim and nothing to sit on outside. ####[['The accommodation was very well built with good quality solid furniture', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There were ample electrical socketss', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The bathroom and plumbing was quite good', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The layout of the resort was fine with ample privacy', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was plenty of parking near the gate', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was easy access to a lovely clean beach, direct from the resort', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There was a pool although deceptively smaller than the brochure pictures', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The restaurant was nicely laid out with a sea view', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' There were outside restaurants as described in the brochure, Napoli being the best', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There are some small local shops ( kiosks) for basic needs', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The fridge worked well as did the electric kettle and hair dryer', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' There was only a buffet breakfast on the Sunday morning, when the resort filled up for the weekend', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['At other times there was a limited menu', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["There wasn't anywhere to hang wet clothes after, say, a swim and nothing to sit on outside", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

Air conditioner well placed. Not a hotel, bit old, but we could sleep well. Mr. Kang offered trips for very good price. He explaned us many things about Vietnam. Highly recommended!!

Overall we had a lovely stay in sapa. We were on the 5th floor city view room and it was very noisy, possible this is not isolated to this particular hotel as the town is very busy. We had a connecting room but the balcony door did not lock in one of the rooms. And in the night a very strong smell of cigarette smoke wafted through our room through the aircon vent. Someone clearly smoking in their room or near the ducts, it was bad enough to wake us. We really wanted to give them a 10 star review as they requested however because of these things we feel an 8 is more honest. ####[['Location was great', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['staff were very helpful', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['bed was comfy', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Rooftoop was lovely', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We didnt eat at the hotel so couldnt comment on the restaurant', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['We were on the 5th floor city view room and it was very noisy, possible this is not isolated to this particular hotel as the town is very busy', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We had a connecting room but the balcony door did not lock in one of the rooms', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' in the night a very strong smell of cigarette smoke wafted through our room through the aircon vent', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

139855,Good location around 5 minutes from the beach. The rooftop pool had a good view across the city. The room was fairly spacious and had basic essentials like air con, comfy bed, fridge, toiletries. The hotel was very noisy. We had a large family who used the hallway and lift as a playground, with the children screaming and crying while the parents shouted up and down the hallway from 5. 30am until midnight each day. We told reception who didn't care or do anything to speak to the family just saying that the hotel was busy. There are alarms on the hotel bedroom doors as they are awkward to close, the alarms are good for safety however the other rooms would leave their doors open with the alarms beeping from early until late which again kept us awake. The hotel is not 4*, more 2 or 3*, it felt very basic and in need of modernising and updating. The pool area was small and needs more comfortable chairs it gets busy very easily. The flooring around the pool was uneven and wobbly which felt dangerous considering how low the glass barrier was on the rooftop 13 floors up. We chose this as there was a gym however there is barely a gym, just one tiny glass room on the rooftop with 3 pieces of equipment, no air con and no fan so it was uncomfortable to use the treadmill.

Just outside the town, and easily walkable with a perfect pool and lovely food, our room was beyond beautiful and again, the staff were the absolute icing on the cake.

They switched us to a different room quickly and without a hassle when my friend and I didn't want to share our hostel room with loud guests. This hostel is very dominated by English backpackers and so it caters to a very party/drinking oriented crowd, so if this is not what you're looking for this is probably not the place for you. While the pool is a nice addition, it's rather small. The breakfast provided was really lacking variety though, and what they did have was not very nice. We were also given stained towels to use and when we asked for new ones they were stained as well. Thank goodness we brought our own! ####[['The location of this hostel is good, about a 10 minute motorbike ride from the beach and there are some lovely local bars, restaurants and tailors in the surrounding area as well', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The staff were pleasant and friendly, with good recommendations and great English skills', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["They switched us to a different room quickly and without a hassle when my friend and I didn't want to share our hostel room with loud guests", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the pool is a nice addition', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["it's rather small", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The breakfast provided was really lacking variety though, and what they did have was not very nice', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We were also given stained towels to use and when we asked for new ones they were stained as well', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["This hostel is very dominated by English backpackers and so it caters to a very party/drinking oriented crowd, so if this is not what you're looking for this is probably not the place for you", 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

If you need more slippers or change the towels, they could always support. It would be better if there is more dust bin inside the room. There was only 1 in the bathroom when we stayed.

139569,We arrived late to this charming hotel, check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade. Our room was well appointed, just as pictured in the photos with a very comfortable bed. In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields. Both the ladies at reception, Xí and Vân, took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind. From helping us book taxis, tours (we booked Golden Bridge), laundry services, massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning, they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional. They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight! This hotel is located halfway between An Bang Beach and Hoi An Old Town, in a peaceful, tranquil rural setting. It’s ideally situated for day trips like basket boat tours and even Tra Que Culinary Village. We loved being able to see the farmers work the land in this authentic setting and walking to nearby little cafés. We used the free bicycles to explore the area a few times, which was very pleasant. It would be a quick 10-15 minute bike ride into town. The pool was a little too cold for us during our one week stay in February, but it was still lovely to sit around on the comfy loungers and listen to the trickling water, like a little oasis. The gentleman who works on the grounds doesn’t speak English, but he works very hard to maintain the property, is the hotel’s security, gardener and I’m sure whatever else needs doing. Our hats off to him! We Canadians highly recommend this little gem of a hotel just outside the busy area. We’d like to thank the staff at Maison Fleur Hoi An for a wonderful stay! Occasionally we had to be patient to get a Grab taxi to come and pick us up at the property as it's a little out of the way. But this is also part of why we liked the hotel. ####[['check in was smooth and we enjoyed a complimentary glass of fresh lemonade', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our room was well appointed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' just as pictured in the photos', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['In the morning we awoke to a beautiful view of the green rice fields', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Both the ladies at reception, Xí and Vân, took excellent care of us and were so gracious and kind', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['From helping us book taxis, tours (we booked Golden Bridge), laundry services, massage and making us delicious breakfasts every morning, they went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and our stay exceptional', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They even come to to work extra early to make sure we have a breakfast before our flight!

179,The staff were by far the most kind and caring people I've met in Vietnam so far. They really took care of me, making sure I was okay as a solo female traveller. Making sure I ate and giving me fruits of they learned that I skip a meal (I wasn't hungry, but I'll take fruits anytime haha). It was warm and cosy, and felt like I was staying with a family. Also loved that it's across the river from the old town and slightly further down from the night market, so you don't get bothered by loud noises late at night, but yet near enough to walk. ####[["The staff were by far the most kind and caring people I've met in Vietnam so far", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They really took care of me, making sure I was okay as a solo female traveller', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Making sure I ate and giving me fruits of they learned that I skip a meal', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' It was warm and cosy, and felt like I was staying with a family', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["Also loved that it's across the river from the old town and slightly further down from the night market, so you don't get bothered by loud noises late at night, but yet near enough to walk", 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

1407,The boat itself is absolutely beautiful. The rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay. It feels magical. The staff were extremely kind and welcoming. We did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized. Kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in Vietnam. All the food was quite good and was included. But, FYI if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise. The staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood. The baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window, so you can look out at the bay, which is great. This ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay. The balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures. No drinks are included and although they have a buy 2 get 1 free happy hour, the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying it would be nice if they were included. On the last day as well we went on the tour to the caves on the bamboo boats, which was great to see. However, there was very little time after the tour before checkout to shower or pack and it felt quite rushed. ####[['The boat itself is absolutely beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The rooms are gorgeous and have large windows looking out onto the bay', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['It feels magical', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The staff were extremely kind and welcoming', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We did the one night cruise and the activities on board were really fun and well organized', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Kayaking around the bay was one of my favourite experiences of our whole trip in Vietnam', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['All the food was quite good and was included', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' if you are not a seafood fan make sure to let the staff know as the dinner was almost entirely seafood otherwise', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The staff were happy to make this adjustment for me and my dinner was amazing even without the seafood', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' The baths in the rooms are perched right next to a large window', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['you can look out at the bay, which is great', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['This ship is a great choice for a cruise on the bay', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The balconies are smaller than expected based on the pictures', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' No drinks are included', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the drinks are relatively expensive and for what your paying', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['it would be nice if they were included', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], [' On the last day as well we went on the tour to the caves on the bamboo boats, which was great to see.', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' there was very little time after the tour before checkout to shower or pack and it felt quite rushed', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

1494,Wonderful time here! While trekking through the jungle, Mr. Co taught me how to use my sense to navigate and search in there. Sometimes, after silently chasing a gibbon family by following their sound, we stayed at the same spot for 15 minutes just to watch their activity. That time we feel like we are a part of the jungle. Homestay's facilities are good. You are also served by two other receptionists (a dog and her child). They will welcome you in the morning when you open your room and notify you when the food is ready.

519,I really liked my stay at Lam Vien Homestay as it was quaint and really comfortable. I adored getting the chance to speak with owner and learn a little more about his and Hue's history. Plus, I arrived so early and they were more accomidating me as I rented a bike and joined one of the other travellers to journey together. My room was ideal, it was on the first floor and had easy access to the bathroom and privacy if wanted. Breakfast and other things were available though I didn't partake as IO have my own dietary means and wanted to see the city which is so full of history and excitement. I finally arrived late in the evening after consuming as much of the wonder that is Hue. I came back to what was supreme quiet and excellent accommodation as I prepared myself some food and go the comfort and quiet of a evening left to my own devices. Being close to both the north and south sides of Hue, I went off to explore as I would leave reasonably early the next morning and was delighted to be so well placed. I really recommend this incredible homestay and encourage you to stay as long as you can because there is so much that makes Hue ideal to travel and experience.

139460,Our experience at Zizi homestay in Sapa was a spiritual journey that allowed us to witness the sacred rituals and beliefs of the Hmong community. The lodge, surrounded by towering peaks, provided a breathtaking setting for our trek. The guided trek led us through sacred sites, ancient temples, and shared moments of spiritual reflection. Each step felt like a step towards embracing the sacred wisdom of Hmong culture. The reverent hosts guided us through traditional ceremonies, offering us insight into their spiritual practices. Back at the lodge, we were treated to a sacred ritual, witnessing the deep reverence the Hmong have for their ancestors and nature. As the sun set, we gathered for a contemplative meditation session, enveloped in the profound tranquility of the mountains. While our overall experience was fantastic, some guests noticed occasional water supply disruptions, which added to the rustic charm but might cause minor inconveniences.

139136,the staff couldn’t speak English but they did their best to help us. they solved the issue below properly. location was good and on walkable distance to some shops. the room was nice and big and clean. the staff helped us book a private chauffeur to go the green tea islands which was great! definitely recommend to go there. we booked a massage at the hotel as we thought this would be good (tecco hotel & spa). we were sent to separate rooms and had to wait there. two ladies came and did our massage… not a good massage!! she was sitting on the massage table (very lazy), was messaging on her phone and even took a phone call during the massage. also we were promised a 1-hour massage but we only got a 20 minute massage. the staff told us that the deal is 20 minute massage and then a spa for the rest of the hour. however, the spa was literally just a shower and a bathtub. if you go to this hotel, then DO NOT take a spa+massage. luckily the staff solved this properly and we only paid for a 20 minute massage. breakfast is from 6-8 which is too early. we did it our first night but skipped it on our second day. ####[['the staff couldn’t speak English but they did their best to help us', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['they solved the issue below properly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['location was good and on walkable distance to some shops', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the room was nice and big and clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the staff helped us book a private chauffeur to go the green tea islands which was great', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['definitely recommend to go there', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we booked a massage at the hotel as we thought this would be good', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['two ladies came and did our massage… not a good massage', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['she was sitting on the massage table (very lazy), was messaging on her phone and even took a phone call during the massage', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' we were promised a 1-hour massage but we only got a 20 minute massage', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the staff told us that the deal is 20 minute massage and then a spa for the rest of the hour. however, the spa was literally just a shower and a bathtub', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['breakfast is from 6-8 which is too early', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

139817,Beautiful woody accommodation in the middle of the nature, with a stunning view of the paddy rice from the second floor balcony. The Thai food was also very good and cheap! Surelee, the owner has to change a little bit her attitude. I understand the linguistic barrier but sometimes the way how she talks can sounds very rude. Her property, which she named a "homestay", doesn't quite reflect what a homestay should be, since, being Italians and having Italian dishes on the menu, we offered her our help to the kitchen staff and she rudely refused. Also, in my opinion she push to much the customers to purchase her trekking tour which are very expensive compared to the ones found walking by the villages.

890,The staff at the Solaria Hotel were absolutely wonderful, everyone was kind, helpful and friendly. The room (401) was at the front of the hotel with a french balcony overlooking the road, but as it was in the old quarter of the city this is normal. The reception area was comfortable, the dining room on floor 8 was bright and airy and breakfast had a good choice of fruit, yogurt, pastries and bread and a choice of cooked eggs. We had an evening meal after a long day out and it was exceptional, lots of menu choices, beautifully presented and very delicious. The hotel explains that whilst it is in a convenient part of the city, the views and space are not as good as the larger hotels but it makes up for that by providing excellent care and dedication and believe me that is exactly what they do.

138322,This place only cost £13 a night for a double room so it was very cheap for Hanoi. The man behind the desk was helpful.

He also booked me a taxi for the early hours the next morning to go to the airport, and it was cheaper than Grab. The location is really good, in a side street very close to the historic centre with loads of bars and restaurants on the doorstep. Towels are provided as well as toothbrush, comb, shampoo and shower gel (although it was a whitening one so I avoided). It didn't seem very clean, there were two hairs on the bed that didn't belong to me. The light fittings on the wall were very dusty and one of them didn't work. The bed was not very comfy. The air conditioning did work but the unit looked ancient and it made a lot of noise. The bathroom is in need of replacing, the tiles and taps/shower were all looking very worn/rusty.

139420,The cruise was efficient with nearly everything run on time. The food was of a good standard - with all the meals provided there is very little to worry about. You won’t go hungry either - plenty on offer at all times. The staff were friendly and happy to help throughout our stay. This is true of the guide we had on our second day (of three). We were the only guests to stay on for 2 nights (although note there is always a combination of single and 2 night guests) so our second day was just us - perfect! We had arranged transfers with La Regina and both arrived on time and took us where we needed to go. The room had all the facilities we needed including air conditioning (very necessary for Westerners visiting Vietnam in July!), lovely bed and private balcony. All the trips had what we needed to participate too. This is not a romantic or quiet cruise; if you want that, I’d look somewhere else. The boat was full when we went and most of the other guests were quiet loud Vietnamese on holiday (it may differ at other times of the year). Personally, we don’t like timetables / schedules so didn’t warm to the frequent announcements but we did get all the activities we were promised.

You can order your breakfast (made to order), go to the beach, swim and when you come back, it's waiting for you in the room, where you can enjoy it in the spacious AC Room. I was able to leave my heavy luggage with them for 3 days, at no charge, I recommend tipping though, this is a true Homestay (they live next door), they are building it up based on our visits. Quiet and a breath of fresh air (ironically in a superhot & humid weather) compared to downtown Hoi An. 15min motorcycle ride through an amazing landscape (see photos).

253,A Friend's Recommendation Unveils the Magic of Zizi Homestay in Sapa I am filled with immense excitement as I recount my extraordinary journey to the captivating landscapes of Sapa, Vietnam. Inspired by a friend's heartfelt recommendation, I embarked on a quest to discover the hidden treasures of this enchanting region. My adventure led me to the remarkable Zizi Homestay, and I can confidently say that it was an experience that exceeded all expectations—a journey that was truly worth every moment. Upon arriving at Zizi Homestay, I was instantly captivated by the beauty of its surroundings. Nestled amidst the awe-inspiring landscapes of Sapa, it stood as a testament to the harmonious coexistence of nature and culture. The gentle embrace of Zizi's warm hospitality and the sincere smiles of the Hmong people made me feel instantly at ease. It was evident from the very beginning that my friend's recommendation was a precious gift. The allure of Zizi Homestay extended far beyond its idyllic setting. It was a gateway to the vibrant tapestry of Hmong culture. With boundless enthusiasm, Zizi welcomed me into her world, eager to share the rich heritage and traditions of her community. I was invited to immerse myself in the fascinating art of batik dyeing, guided by the skilled hands of the Hmong artisans. It was a mesmerizing experience that allowed me to witness firsthand the intricate craftsmanship and the indomitable spirit woven into every stitch. Throughout my stay, Zizi proved to be an extraordinary hostess, going above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of my journey was filled with wonder and delight. From guiding me on breathtaking treks through the emerald rice terraces to introducing me to the flavors of traditional Hmong cuisine, Zizi's genuine care and passion created an atmosphere of true warmth and hospitality. ####[]
1702,There was a cafe right outside the hotel that was affordably priced and i like how the hotel was tucked into a quiet alley. Japantown isn't super close to everything in downtown Saigon but to many places just a 15 min walk away. The staff were TOP tier and were so friendly even late at night. They were helpful and so kind. Breakfast buffet was decent, I ate there everyday. Mini stop on the top of the alley and many places to eat nearby. Laundry service is WAY too expensive. I would suggest finding on your own and them having it delivered (I did this). I find the layout of the room a bit odd. Had the deluxe but felt the shower and toilet was too exposed for the room and the bum spray was a little bit too harsh to use easily. Only one elevator but it's not too bad to leave easily. But really no complaints I enjoyed my week here! ####[['There was a cafe right outside the hotel that was affordably priced and i like how the hotel was tucked into a quiet alley', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [" Japantown isn't super close to everything in downtown Saigon but to many places just a 15 min walk away", 'Amenity', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The staff were TOP tier and were so friendly even late at night', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They were helpful and so kind', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast buffet was decent, I ate there everyday', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Mini stop on the top of the alley and many places to eat nearby', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Laundry service is WAY too expensive', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' I find the layout of the room a bit odd', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Had the deluxe but felt the shower and toilet was too exposed for the room and the bum spray was a little bit too harsh to use easily', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["Only one elevator but it's not too bad to leave easily", 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], [' no complaints I enjoyed my week here', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I would suggest finding on your own and them having it delivered', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

It started off with little bit of a snatch theft incident and a police report - their staff stayed with us through all 5 hours and translated everything with the police (thanks Shuang!!). The owners of the hotel, a sweet pair of aunty and uncle, tried to make up for it by packing a small picnic for our Mua Cave visit.

Surfaces in the room were somewhat worn out, and there was some visible water damage in the bathroom, tiles were cracked etc. You could hear all the noises from the hallway. The walls/windows were so thin, that it felt like the windows were open because the traffic noises were so loud, and it was a little hard to sleep. Update // They asked us to do a written review about the hotel upon check out. We wrote same things on that and here in the booking review. Mostly great things about the service and staff, only complaints was the noises and the fact that the room might need some updates/renovations. We waited in the hotel lobby for a car to pick us up to the airport, and the manager came to us apologizing and they gave us a 50% refund from the car service. We thought that was unnessecary, but it felt nice that they reacted to our feedback. I also wrote this booking review waiting in the lobby, usually I wait to get out of the hotel to do that, I should’ve done it now too. The manager had seen my booking review and came back to talk to us, asking us to change the review from 8 to 10. We felt super uncomfortable that he asked us to do so. We just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. For that point we had nothing but great things to say about the staff, but now it left us with a bad taste to our mouths, and this wasn’t a great ending to our 2-week trip to Vietnam, which had been nothing but lovely so far. I had to lower the grade because we didn’t appreciate this kind of doing. ####[['Staff was great and super helpful.

1617,Great views. Great location. Awesome pool with swim-up bar. Super comfortable bed. Surprisingly quiet at night. Staff are all amazingly polite, professional, and friendly. Great buffet breakfast options (Eastern and Western). Only a 5-minute walk to the night market. Family friendly. Couple friendly. A little pricey, but it's a luxury resort, so that's to be expected. And being an upscale resort, there are some entitled guests that come there and are unnecessarily rude to staff for things that are out of the staff's control (and the staff were all very polite and professional in response)... but those guests' behavior is not the hotel's fault. My advice: don't be those rude guests; you're on vacation after all.

994,The staff people at the reception are very very nice, smiley, helpful and at the restaurant some staff people are nice too. The bedroom is confortable, the bed I slept is so well and it's so comfy.

The decoration of the hotel is beautiful and modern but with warm and bright colours. You can't actually open the window in the room (since it's a big one with view on the area) so that's what I didn't appreciate since I like having air coming into my room. Especially one girl, at the restaurant/lounge area don't know how to smile, that's so impolite, they have a face like you're annoying, and giving them some job to do they don't want to do.

Decent place to work as well, because of the good Wi Fi. The price was amazing. Really incredibly cheap for what you get. The bathroom had a water leak next to the toilet, there were wet marks and hairs on the sofa and bed, the view across from the hotel is kind of a trash yard or a demolished area. I'm not sure if it was a residential building as well, but there was a family staying on our floor that had two rooms, and left the door open between them, yelling very loudly in the hallway at all hours. Overall it was just not relaxing or comfortable. I can't hold anything against the staff, but my experience here was dreadful. I'm sorry.

It's worth noting that two of the dogs are very friendly and like being petted, but two of them are not.

1112,Hanoi Marvellous was the gift that kept on giving. We used it as a base for numerous trips to surrounding areas and stayed an overall of 5 nights here. The staff were truely exceptional. Waking up early to prepare a takeaway breakfast for us at 5am, providing so much information for us, holding our bags for us during our trips away, greeting us like friends every-time we arrived and even decorating our room with a welcome home flyers and petals on our bed for our last night! We felt so at home and treated so well by the wonderful staff here.

140057,Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely, airy, clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea. The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city, particularly at night. The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter's birthday (highly recommend for a fun afternoon/evening) Breakfast is great in the hotel, but there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about. Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night. Be prepared though as it was very busy on all the surrounding streets, so if you don't like crowds, you'll have to see the fire-breathing from a distance !! This is isn't a criticism of the hotel, but be aware there is a lot of development going on in Da Nang and lots of construction site. On one of the days there was a lot of drilling and banging coming from a nearby site and there is a stage on the beach directly below the hotel that plays loud music most night until 11pm. Also be prepared for noise form the street outside (tooting of horns, etc) and also the fact the beach is packed at 5. 30am with people watching the sunrise. None of these things can be controlled by the hotel though and they didn't detract from our stay. In short, if you want peace and quiet Da Nang is probably not the place for you.... ####[['Overall the hotel was fantastic with lovely, airy, clean rooms with amazing balconies overlooking the beach and sea', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The rooftop pool is just stunning and the top floor restaurant also has great food with amazing views over the city, particularly at night', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["The staff were great and very helpful in helping us organise trips to Hue and Sun World for our daughter's birthday ", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast is great in the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['there are plenty of other options nearby too if you want to get out and about', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our girls loved Crazy Cow ice cream and we also visited the Dragon Bridge on the Saturday night', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

138544,This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it's very near the Lake, the cute little streets, restaurants, night market, you name it. When you enter the hotel, you notice that the narrow entrance - which is normal for all hotels and houses in Hanoi - opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours, furniture and benches, and the most welcoming staff. Will, the person who came straight to our taxi when we arrived, explained everything about the hotel and Hanoi as if he was a tour-guide, and he made us feel at home and able to ask questions about the city and possible visits. Will is not the only gem in this hotel, as other staff members are equally helpful and friendly and the whole atmosphere is one of warmth and kindness, which all contributes to a great flexibility of the service you can expect. The hotel has a lift, a good sky bar that overlooks the sights nearby, the rooms have great beds (thank you) and a good lay-out for the space in an inner city hotel. It also has a lovely breakfast place (beautiful decoration) with good choices of food and drinks, and again great staff. However, one of the surprises for us was that the food served n the Skybar and roomservice is the best we had in Hanoi - by far. So we hope they create an inviting restaurant or rooftop eatery that creates a place for the chef to display her/his talents. Other good things to write about are the Spa treatments - really nice and knowledgeable staff, and very convenient and clean - and the design of the place. Vietnam is colourful, and this is reflected in the interior design. We saw tourists stay here, as well as business people and locals, so we felt right at home. The hotel could possibly offer water refill-locations so less plastic is used, but it seems that Vietnam should tackle that problem in more hotels and locations. ####[["This hotel is in a very convenient location when visiting Hanoi as it's very near the Lake", 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['opens up to a beautiful lobby with gorgeous colours, furniture and benches', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['and the most welcoming staff.

1558,Beautiful open see through lobby, lovely ocean view rooms with a balcony, superb breakfast buffet, wonderful staff and service, and a playroom for the kids with an attendant. The location is perfect, in the city but quieter when compared to the main road area. We ate at the restaurant several times, the seafood buffet was good, a la carte was really good too. The spa was lovely. We were very happy with our stay at Furama. It was great overall, we were very happy with our stay, difficult to find anything wrong. To note, for a family of 2 adults + 2 children, it would make sense to book an ocean view suite rather than take a garden view room. This is because when they say 2 twin beds, it means 2 single beds in the garden room which aren't useful for 2 adults and 2 kids. So you have to take an extra bed at an added cost. Hence for a similar price, take the ocean view room which come with 2 platform sofa's which can convert to 2 kids beds and a fantastic view! Mr. Tung at the reception was very helpful and friendly. ####[['Beautiful open see through lobby, lovely ocean view rooms with a balcony', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['superb breakfast buffet', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['wonderful staff and service', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' a playroom for the kids with an attendant', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The location is perfect, in the city but quieter when compared to the main road area', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We ate at the restaurant several times, the seafood buffet was good, a la carte was really good too', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The spa was lovely', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' We were very happy with our stay', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' we were very happy with our stay, difficult to find anything wrong', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' for a family of 2 adults + 2 children, it would make sense to book an ocean view suite rather than take a garden view room', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], [' Mr. Tung at the reception was very helpful and friendly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [" This is because when they say 2 twin beds, it means 2 single beds in the garden room which aren't useful for 2 adults and 2 kids", 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['So you have to take an extra bed at an added cost', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ["Hence for a similar price, take the ocean view room which come with 2 platform sofa's which can convert to 2 kids beds and a fantastic view", 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]
203,The bed and room was huge. Comfy bed. I booked a trip through the hotel. A 3 island speed boat tour. They picked me up late, and then when I got on the boat i realised they had put me on the wrong trip. It was a party boat and not a speedboat, and then we only went to two islands. When I questioned this at the hotel they said as I did not want to do the mud bath part I chose not to go on the trip I asked for, however that was always optional. After bursting into tears, and being shouted at by the tour guide on the phone, they gave me 100,000/600,000 VND back. ####[['The bed and room was huge', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Comfy bed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' I booked a trip through the hotel.

The decor of the room and the hotel in general was very nice! They have used natural materials in a very pleasing and balanced way. The tea set that they provided in the room was exceptional – it came with loose leaf tea, a kettle with a built-in sieve and two beautiful ceramic cups. We had a lovely view of the emerging skyline in the vibrant city of Da Nang. The room had a balcony and natural light coming in from 2 directions. The location is convenient.

1621,The property is beautiful, in an extremely peaceful area. Even though it was winter while we were there, the pool looked gorgeous and we gave the private plunge pool a go too! The food from the restaurant was lovely, and we had all our meals there. The wine list is also excellent! By far the most exceptional part of the experience was the staff, who went above and beyond to make our stay special.

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this hotel as one of the budget-friendly options in the island. They lock the front doors at night but the staff are easily contactable to open the door even at early hours of the morning. Maybe the hotel could switch to a passcode/keycard system for this as not to disturb the staff too much?Food could also be a bit better but this is not too much of a drawback for the value you are getting from your stay.

During our days there, I got pretty sick one day and I did not feel well at all. Two of your wonderful employees took special care of me until I was feeling better. I am very thankful and I felt in good hands, since there was no doctor available.

1137,The location in the Old Quarter was fantastic and close to everything. The street at the front of the hotel is closed at the weekend, so you may struggle to be dropped outside. This really isn't a problem! All staff were fantastic. There are so many trips and variations on offer and so it was difficult to know what was best for the budget. We listened to Mai's advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted. Everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back. For trips to Sapa, I would recommend the individual cabin on the bus as this was a godsend after such a long walk, try to get the cabin near the front as the ride is smoother and take mosquito spray. Travelling with children, Mai made this much more relaxed! We would recommend the Met restaurant close to the hotel. ####[['The location in the Old Quarter was fantastic and close to everything', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The street at the front of the hotel is closed at the weekend, so you may struggle to be dropped outside', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['All staff were fantastic', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["We listened to Mai's advice and we ended up with exactly what we wanted", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Everything was organised from the moment we left the hotel until the time we got back', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

The best pineapple juice we've ever had. Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast. - The room was huge, well thought out and as ascetically pleasing. - The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and "cute" at night - Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround. - The beach is a minutes walk away and surprisingly nice and clean. - Good number of affordable bars and restaurants (we went to Mr Hoà's Kitchen and The Tamarinde Tree, Baby Mustard) - Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies, local area. Or to cycle to Hoi An old town, busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly. - Can get a grab from the end of the road in to Hoi An old town for about 75k VND (10 minute journey), we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening. - The hotel is small and therefore the pool is, if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves - It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren't aware. - Bikes could do with some maintenance, oil, tyres, new bell etc - but this seems to be a theme in Vietnam :) ####[['Tanya was a exceptional host, very passionate about her hotel and ensuring you have the best stay', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast was super, a good selection of fresh items that are pre-ordered the evening before', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["The best pineapple juice we've ever had", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The room was huge, well thought out and as ascetically pleasing', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Options range from beef Pho right through to Avocado on Toast', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The pool was very clean and the area was beautiful and relaxing and "cute" at nigh', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Laundry was affordable and quick turnaround', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' The beach is a minutes walk away', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['surprisingly nice and clean', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Good number of affordable bars and restaurants', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Free cycle hire to explore the picturesque rice paddies, local area', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' to cycle to Hoi An old town, busy road but there are cycle lanes surprisingly', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we would recommend staying in An Bang beach and then travelling to Hoi An during the day or evening', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The hotel is small and therefore the pool is', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' if the hotel if fully booked and everyone decides to have a pool day at once then could get crowded but we had the pool area to ourselves', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ["It would be nice if we were given a couple of bar and restaurant recommendations on arrival as there are some gems in the immediate area that can be missed if you aren't aware", 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Bikes could do with some maintenance, oil, tyres, new bell', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

There are free bikes to use at the hotel which we loved and took them to Old Town and discovered the local area. The staff are on hand 24/7 to help out and even have a Whats App if you need their assistance whilst out etc. If you need anything the staff are happy to help.

139620,The location is central, there is a supermarket nearby, nice Banh-Mi-Stands around the corner and a coffee shop closeby (E-Coffee). There were toilet amenities (soap, TP, toothbrush). The AC was working and quiet. We booked this hotel. We arrived after a long journey, and a sign was saying: we send you a message with all booking infos to self check-in. Said message never arrived. I contacted the responsible, who was quick to answer: we have issues with the climate control we have to rebook you to another location. That's how we got to Supertramp. Funny thing: it happened to another lady while we were there and she told us they rebooked her because the other one was full. This hotel looks way nicer than the other - which is why we think it's a scam. Now, reading other reviews, I realized it happened before. Coming to Supertramp:It's a construction site!At first we got offered a room with no window, which was not what we booked. They showed us another room, which we took. The room contained a kitchen and a washing-maschine (both not working) and a bed. The room was so tiny that we couldn't put our bags on the ground. Why do you put a not functioning kitchen+machine if there is no space already?!The cupboards were moist, some dirty towels were roting in them. The room was dirty. I made the mistake of looking behind the bed and in the cupboard - so much dirt, dust and spiderwebs. The walls are quite thin and not soundproof, so we heard everything (from neighbors to elevator and construction work).We wanted to pay online, but they didn't accept it: only cash. As we just arrived, we didn't have VND yet and explained that we would contact them as soon as we did and pay the bill. We stayed 3 days. Within the first day we got contacted 3 times to ask for the money (even though we previously made an agreement). In the end we got woken up by a random lady the next morning at 8a. m (she wouldn't stop knocking, spoke no English, just said "money,money". Nobody told us she would come and wake us up.

1102,New hotel, ok location Quite simply, the hotel lied...about many things. Lie 1) I booked this hotel for my wife's birthday as it has a spa centre, as per the info on their website. There is NO operating spa centre. When I asked about this I was told it was still under construction and that if I wanted to book a spa we can walk around the corner. Lie 2) I'm training for a triathlon so when I saw that the fitness centre is open 24 hours, I thought great! The gym closes at 7pm and is NOT 24 hours. Also, the treadmills don't work. The belt stalls with each step so you can't even walk let alone run. And there are no sanitizing wipes, towels, bins or even access to water. Lie 3) The sunset bar looked great on their website, especially with the snacks and "signature cocktails" noted. There are NO cocktails and no snacks. And what the heck is the point of a pool and bar that closes at 7pm? I kept being told, not enough staff. Lie 4) The restaurant '12 Kitchen' is listed on their website as serving a buffet breakfast and dinner. There is NO dinner served and the breakfast closes at 9:30am. Lie 5) The hotel is listed on booking. com as 5 stars?! I'm not sure on which planet they got this rating but it is a 3 star at best. Definitely not an international standard 5 star. There is also, NO room service and nothing in the mini bar in the rooms. The rooms are ok, but...Upon arrival, the top shelves in the wardrobes were very dusty and we had to wipe them down before using them. The rooms were relatively clean but definitely not to a high standard. Housekeeping staff didn't even wash the glasses on a number of occasions. There is only a kettle with a couple of sachets of coffee issued. The toilets....oh the toilets...if you plan on using anything more than 3 individual squares of toilet paper, be prepared for a blocked toilet.

The view from the pool is breathtaking, the staff really helpful and as a bonus during really hot days: the pool is in the shade of the 22nd floor in the afternoon. The beach view rooms come with one little drawback: music playing through the night on the beach audible even on the higher floors with windows closed. For guests with light sleep, city view might be a good consideration (not a bad view anyhow - see photo). Closing time of the rooftop bar at 22:00 is something guests have to count with.

576,All of the staff was super nice and very responsive to our needs.

The hotel is a 10-min walk from the city center and there are only 6 rooms, which makes it quieter at night. We could also use the shared kitchen to cook our baby meals. Only Nhi and his girlfriend speak good English, so it can be difficult to get understood with the others. I think it’s part of the experience and enjoy that, but be warned.

One small complaint, they were unable to give us a complimentary 2pm checkout, so we booked the hotel shuttle to take us to the airport at 1 for a 3. 45 flight. The man then told us we dont need that much time to be at the airport. And tried pushing us back to 2. We compromised for 1. 45.

1439,The property is converted from an old government office building to homestay. Its design is based on the concept of local ethnic groups in Sapa.

The staff were super helpful and friendly during my stay. They recommended some cafes with awesome view and try their best to fulfill my request. This homestay serve vegan food for lunch and dinner. I tried their local Vietnamese style began food and it was delicious. The chef has many years of working experience in hospitality line. She worked in 5-stars resorts in South East Asia and Middle East. As it was low season due to covid-19, the owner took extra mile by offering me a personal trip from Sapa to Y Ty when i asked him for tour package.

The staff always ask if you want anything special cooked for breakfast and went out of their way to order us yummy pho for breakfast (they don’t usually have this on the menu. The pool is actually bigger than what we expected and was made great use of during the hot Hoi An summer heat . Overall excellent value for money There wasn’t a lot to fault about this hotel. If I have to be picky, it was probably further away from market then we imagined. But it was extremely hot when we were there,and we aren’t game enough for motorcycles, so it may have felt further away then it was . Vihn (I think that’s his name , the only male front concierge) can work on his customer service skills. He could see we were checking out and lots of suitcases, given we had to walk down three flights of stairs, he could have at least offered to assist.

The family helped us hire a scooter and have explored the region they also have bicycles here to use, they have made us feel so at home and loved by all the family.

The property offers several breakfast options including eggs, pancakes or yogurt and fruit. They also do dinner. We thoroughly enjoyed a menu of chicken stir-fry, shrimp stir-fry and spring rolls at the property. Much better quality than the dinner we had in Sapa. But the gem is the gardens surrounding the property, they are absolutely stunning. There are several sitting areas to enjoy a glass of wine in the evening. In addition the staff is very helpful and accommodating. Mr. Nam Hong can arrange a guide for treks in the area and tickets for Fansipan mountain. Laundry service is also available.

140239,Pretty much the perfect stay. This resort is pretty amazing. It's right on the ocean and has got a gigantic swimming pool with a bar in it and tons of comfy mattresses and long chairs to chill, enjoy the sun and read a book. The three restaurants on site are pretty good and the breakfast definitely wins it all. That buffet is the best way to start the day. Room was very comfy, great bed, spacious, clean and with the private pool it was just the cherry on top. But what made our stay even better was the staff. The whole staff team was absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel. If we really want to find a couple of things to improve, then it would be: - a bit more maintainance of the pool mattresses and long chairs which are showing a bit of fatigue.- the price of the restaurants which is a bit high. ####[["It's right on the ocean", 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['got a gigantic swimming pool with a bar in it and tons of comfy mattresses and long chairs to chill', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The three restaurants on site are pretty good', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the breakfast definitely wins it all', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Room was very comfy, great bed, spacious, clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' the private pool it was just the cherry on top', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['what made our stay even better was the staff', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The whole staff team was absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were the only guests in the hotel', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' a bit more maintainance of the pool mattresses and long chairs which are showing a bit of fatigue', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['the price of the restaurants which is a bit high', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['high', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

Beach area is small but with great sand and is full of small fish/crabs/etc to explore. The resort is extremely quiet, which is what we were looking for. Staff was very friendly and extremely helpful in getting bookings with John's tours, scooter rental, airport shuttles, and we extended our trip 2 days. They even assisted guests who ran low on gas due to gas stations closing early for Tet. Be aware that the walls are paper thin so you will hear anything happening next door - as it was a slow period we were the only ones for most of our stay and only heard neighbors a few times. If you are planning to explore the south, it's a bit of a commute, but the whole island s small enough that it's no problem if you are comfortable with scooters. ####[['Large room with huge bed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Mattresses are very firm as is common across SE Asia', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Air conditioner so no problems staying cool when needed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Beach area is small but with great sand and is full of small fish/crabs/etc to explore', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The resort is extremely quiet, which is what we were looking for', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [" Staff was very friendly and extremely helpful in getting bookings with John's tours, scooter rental, airport shuttles, and we extended our trip 2 days", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They even assisted guests who ran low on gas due to gas stations closing early for Te', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Be aware that the walls are paper thin so you will hear anything happening next door', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

139969,The staff could not have been friendlier! We were invited to spend Tet with the entire family (there was only about 30 of them) and they were all lovely. The bed was very comfortable and came with a mosquito net around it. The rooms were small but no more than what we needed, with numerous hooks on the wall. Breakfast was also very nice. It was located on the outskirts of Du Gia and, therefore, relatively far away from everything.

The breakfast is buffet style with vegetarian and non vegetarian options, nothing fancy but abundant and tasty. Also, you get a free beer coupon every night you stay. totally a good value for the price you pay, specially for backpackers! I like everything, if I have to point something out maybe it’s that some facilities need maintenance, the shower didn’t work well for couple days, the electronic knob in my room had a problem, BUT nothing really significant, you can deal with all of these or also you can tell to the staff and they will do their best to fix it. ####[['The hostel is in a good location', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['you can go to must of place just by walking', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' The staff is kind and always keen to help', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The breakfast is buffet style with vegetarian and non vegetarian options', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['nothing fancy but abundant and tasty', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['you get a free beer coupon every night you stay', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['totally a good value for the price you pay', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['specially for backpackers', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I like everything', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['some facilities need maintenance', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' the shower didn’t work well for couple days', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the electronic knob in my room had a problem', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['you can deal with all of these or also you can tell to the staff and they will do their best to fix it', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

139222,From the moment I set foot in the door the staff were amazing from start to finish. Tommy (Manh) looked after me like I was part of his family. I ended up getting scammed by a cab driver as it was my first trip to Hanoi and I didn't know any better. 1 call to Tommy and he came straight over to sort it out! He calls you cabs, rents you bikes, changes money cheaply and get you sim cards. Its a hotel but also a one stop for all your needs becuase they really care about you having the best time possible. I cannot speak highly enough of my experience there with them. I had a balcony room, it was very clean, serviced each day I was there and everything worked as I should have. If you are looking to rent a place in the heart of old quarter, which is within walking distance of a lot of things to do, then this is definitely the place to go! Oh and make sure you get the breakfast. It was fantastic 12/10 That I had to leave!

139662,Nothing The room was not cleaned properly when we arrived. They offered an “upgrade” as compensation but this room was also dirty. The buns were full of trash, hair all over the floor and bed, stains on the sheets, etc. After complaining again, it was clear this was the cleaning standard of the hotel so being tired from our trip we decided to just accept it. The next day, whilst we were out on a tour, my booking was marked as a no show. We spoke to staff that evening and they said it was a mistake so I booked again for the following night. This time it was cancelled again during the night. They clearly didn’t want me to write a bad review and do this whenever there are complaints. I had to request a review form off booking. com support to write this. I would not trust the review score at all. This was one of the worst hotels I have stayed at in Vietnam. ####[['The room was not cleaned properly when we arrived', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['They offered an “upgrade” as compensation but this room was also dirty', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' The buns were full of trash, hair all over the floor and bed, stains on the sheets, etc', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['After complaining again, it was clear this was the cleaning standard of the hotel so being tired from our trip we decided to just accept it', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['We spoke to staff that evening and they said it was a mistake so I booked again for the following night', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['This time it was cancelled again during the night', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['This was one of the worst hotels I have stayed at in Vietnam', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

818,It is quite a modern hostel with all facilities. In fact it looks like a good hotel. There is plenty of space in the dorms, and in the restaurant area near reception. The beds are large and comfortable. In fact the beds are like a capsule, so once you close the curtain, there is full privacy. The bathrooms are sufficient and well equipped. They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop. I rented motorbike from here. They have really new and good quality bikes. The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house. They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat, cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike. The extra luggage can also be stored for free. They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop. The staff at the reception speaks and understands English. While the facilities are top notch, their maintenance is not upto the mark. People wear shoes in the dorms, there is nobody responsible for the lockers. There are lockers but the key is not available. I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people. They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests. The dorms are air conditioned, but since the beds are capsule type, there is no ventilation inside the cubicle. It would be nice if there was a separate fan for each cubicle. ####[['It is quite a modern hostel with all facilities', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' In fact it looks like a good hotel', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There is plenty of space in the dorms, and in the restaurant area near reception', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The beds are large and comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' the beds are like a capsule, so once you close the curtain, there is full privacy', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The bathrooms are sufficient and well equipped', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They provide motorbike rental and tour services for Hà Giang Loop', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They have really new and good quality bikes', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The bikes are very well maintained as they have a workshop also in house', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They also provided all basic necessities like raincoat, cover for the bag and straps to tie on the bike', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The extra luggage can also be stored for free', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They also provide laundry in 4 hours which is very useful after the loop', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The staff at the reception speaks and understands English', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['While the facilities are top notch, their maintenance is not upto the mark', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['there is nobody responsible for the lockers', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['There are lockers but the key is not available', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I think the staff is not equipped to handle rush of people', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['They seem to be overwhelmed and lost when there are more guests', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The dorms are air conditioned', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' It would be nice if there was a separate fan for each cubicle', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

139572,Bamboo Farmstay is where I enjoyed the most authentic Vietnamese hospitality experience of my entire trip. The owner, Nam, his sister, and the entire family were extremely kind, attentive, and caring throughout our stay. Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh, but I insisted on paying for it, as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me. Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex, a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future. I highly recommend visiting this area now, before the crowds descend. Nam's farmstay is a hidden gem, and I'm glad I chose it over other homestays that were located in a cramped area with a challenging road. This farmstay, on the other hand, is situated on a good road, close to the main thoroughfare that leads to two of Ninh Binh's main attractions: the pagoda and the river tour. The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent, and the Vietnamese cuisine they serve is simply delicious. Although they normally close at 9 PM, they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry. While the rooms are quite basic, they offer air conditioning and hot showers, and for the price, they are an unbeatable deal - under $10 per night! You'll also have the chance to stay in a charming bamboo bungalow, which is a real treat. All in all, I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future. I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience. ####[['The owner, Nam, his sister, and the entire family were extremely kind, attentive, and caring throughout our stay', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Nam even lent me a traditional Vietnamese hat for a photo op during our tour of Bai Dinh, but I insisted on paying for it, as he was offering it for such a reasonable price and had kindly lent it to me', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Bamboo Farmstay is conveniently located near the Bai Dinh temple complex, a vast area of temples that is sure to attract a large influx of tourists in the near future', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I highly recommend visiting this area now', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The farmstay offers bicycles and motorbikes for rent', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Although they normally close at 9 PM, they kindly kept the kitchen open for us when we arrived late and hungry', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['While the rooms are quite basic, they offer air conditioning and hot showers, and for the price, they are an unbeatable deal - under $10 per night', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I would definitely choose to stay at Bamboo Farmstay again if I return to Ninh Binh in the future', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' I wholeheartedly recommend this charming farmstay to any traveler seeking a genuine Vietnamese experience', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

It's probably a 2 star equivalent in Europe with a 3 or 4 star shower. Would suit a long stay. Like a month to really emmerse in the city or if you had studies to do. Would recommend this hostel/hotel. They take visa and card payments which is great option. Like most things really at this price point. But only thing really was the door to my room number 5 on 4th floor, was a little battered and slight cracks and gaps could be seen. But it did lock! The other doors seemed in better shape.

138795,It is run and built by the family, the bungalows are just beautiful and make you feel free, not to mention the fantastic view of the rice fields. They welcomed me very well and helped me with transportation, there are not many alternatives besides a few local cabs. The food was fantastic and plentiful. As for communication I used to write directly to the guy in whatsapp in English and it worked very well. If you are a nature lover, you can't miss this stage. I had a hard time figuring out how to get there, better to contact the facility in advance and ask for directions. Pu Luong as far as tourism is concerned is not yet developed e. g. with already organized tours, you have to plan well for travel within and figure out what you want to see maybe ask the family for advice in advance. Even to move later in Ninh Binh I could not find any bus but had to take a cab. ####[[' the bungalows are just beautiful and make you feel free, not to mention the fantastic view of the rice fields', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They welcomed me very well and helped me with transportation', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The food was fantastic and plentiful', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

139586,This is the first bad review i’ve ever written so far. We booked this hotel because they should offer a buffet breakfast and they should also have a gym. But non of them was provided. There is also almost no breakfast possibilities in the sourroundings exept pho or seafood. We booked a deluxe room in a (apparently) 4 star hotel, but the room we more like a good budget doubleroom. The queensize bed was cozy, but iz was not one double bed but 2 single beds next to each other. The room was only cleaned once during the stay of 4 days. So in conclusion we would not recommend this hotel if you expect a little bit more comfort. ####[['We booked this hotel because they should offer a buffet breakfast and they should also have a gym.

138579,Great location, staff are amazing, new hotel with modern facilities. Breakfast was yummy with lots of options. An oasis in the middle of the city. Laundry was a little pricey which is common in hotels. The service was fast and of a high standard. If you're in a rush it's worth it otherwise use a local service. Tour desk seeds work as the options are limited. Ended up booking tours online. The city view room does not have much of a view as it is a small city.

182,The facilities of the apartment are great. Brand new building. The studio I stayed has everything I needed except the hairdryer didn’t work. The swimming pool was stunning. The organisation and communication was poor!! I requested a double bed but I had twin room. I’m the person who can’t sleep on a tiny bed. I realised that I made booking with an individual owner, not with the hotel which means any issue you have to deal directly with the owner, not the hotel staff. The staff from the owner came without notice, ring the bell and ask to pay the bill. She admitted her mistake of not providing a double bed and reduced the payment. regardless I couldn’t sleep. This room includes breakfast but be aware that it’s not hotel breakfast!!!! They take you to a local eatery for breakfast. The owner poorly communicates so the restaurant staff asked me to pay for the meal. After a looooooooooong and frustrating conversations between hotel management, owner and restaurant staff, you will be told by the owner “I will pay”. That’s it. He just hang off the phone!!! This is the least thing you want to deal with before your morning flight! ####[['The facilities of the apartment are great', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Brand new building', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The studio I stayed has everything I needed except the hairdryer didn’t work', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The swimming pool was stunning', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The organisation and communication was poor', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I requested a double bed but I had twin room', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The staff from the owner came without notice, ring the bell and ask to pay the bill.
