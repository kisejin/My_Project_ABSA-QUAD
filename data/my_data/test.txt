138760,The pool was nice. The location (close to the night market) was also good. I would really not recommend this hotel. We are by no means picky people and have travelled extensively, but this is one of the worst hotels we have ever encountered in terms of price/quality. The room was not cleaned before our arrival (two half dead cockroaches in the bathroom), it was not cleaned during our stay until we specifically asked for it, thus also no clean towels. The place did not only have cockroaches upon arrival, but we kept encountering them. Although we know this might just be the climate, we did not encounter them anywhere else during 3 weeks in Vietnam. The shower was cold and their solution was just to let it run longer to heat up, which resulted in even more poor water supply than it was already and only made the shower what can maybe be described as lukewarm. The water pressure was almost non existent. The airconditioning did not work most of the time. Most of the food on the breakfast buffet was stale and tasted terrible.

609,rien My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare. From the outset, the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous. The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic English. In a highly unprofessional move, he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking. com platform, promising “better apartments, better views, and more check-in options.” He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times! And after reading reviews from previous guests, I discovered that those who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn’t get any of the promised benefits. The deceit didn’t stop there. On the check-in day, the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower. This was a complete bait and switch, and it left us feeling utterly duped. To add insult to injury, the apartment itself was a disaster. The furniture was old, worn, and filthy, and the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online. It was smaller, older, and lacked any charm or modern decoration. The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding. As if that weren’t enough, the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay. We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water. It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard. In short, our stay at Landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism. I urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere. It’s simply not worth the stress, frustration, and betrayal. ####[['My stay at Landmark 81 turned out to be an absolute nightmare', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' the communication with the owner was nothing short of horrendous', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The person in charge was not only unresponsive but could barely speak basic Englis', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['In a highly unprofessional move, he continually insisted that we pay a deposit outside the Booking. com platform, promising “better apartments, better views, and more check-in options', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['He tried to push this sketchy deposit on us no less than 10 times!', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['who made the mistake of paying never saw their money again and didn’t get any of the promised benefits', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The deceit didn’t stop there', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' the owner switched our booking from the modern Landmark 81 tower to the older and significantly less appealing Landmark 1 tower', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['This was a complete bait and switch', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' it left us feeling utterly duped', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' the apartment itself was a disaster', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The furniture was old, worn, and filthy', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' the apartment bore no resemblance to what was advertised online', 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['It was smaller, older, and lacked any charm or modern decoration.', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The discrepancy between what was promised and what was delivered was astounding', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the AC unit was faulty and leaked throughout our stay', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We had to keep towels on the floor constantly to soak up the puddles of water', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['It was not only inconvenient but also a significant safety hazard', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' our stay at Landmark 81 was a colossal disappointment filled with deception and unprofessionalism', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I urge all potential guests to steer clear of this property and find accommodations elsewhere', 'Loyalty', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' It’s simply not worth the stress, frustration, and betrayal', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

1945,The location is good with many amenities nearby, however not suitable for travellers with private car as there is no car parking.

The hotel has bikes available that you can use whenever you want to go into town (15-20 min ride ) or you can rent a motorcycle if you have the license.

138400,First impressions - amazing use of space and a great meet and greet. Breakfast - excellent, very fresh and different each day Laundry service - free and done for you, which is just great! Location - whilst not the most central location, the host got us taxi's as we couldn't use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim! We also used Google maps and the local bus, which is very cheap and reliable! So I didn't find location as issue at all. My husband loved the free gym! Whilst we did love our stay I feel it necessary to talk about what we didn't like. This place doesn't know what it wants yo be! It's guests are mainly young English teachers who actually live there medium to long term, so it's their home! We felt a bit like we were staying in their house. They are young, and with that came lots of night time noise, and socialising with friends not guests of the homestay right under our window until 2am on a couple of occasions. I expect young people to be noisy, it's normal, but I felt at the cost to other guests. This is because the place is mixed with different types of guests, and doesn't really have a true identity. This mixed with a very hard uncomfortable bed equaled a major lack of sleep for me! However, we did still enjoy our booking, but I feel this feedback is necessary for mid age guests, where noise might be an issue. ####[['amazing use of space and a great meet and greet', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast - excellent, very fresh and different each day', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Laundry service - free and done for you, which is just great', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Location - whilst not the most central location', 'Amenity', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], [" the host got us taxi's as we couldn't use the grab App as we only had a local electronic sim", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['My husband loved the free gym', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' we did love our stay', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['we did still enjoy our booking', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

The hotel was near Hon Gai and Bai Chay beach, Sunworld Park and Quang Ninh museum and so many tourist attractions. It took me only 10-30 minutes to get to any famous places that I wanted. The room has 2 bedrooms and it looks just like new and of course, very clean. The hosts are nice too, he seems to take care of his property very well =))) With that level of price, this is such an optimal choice. I've stayed in Muong Thanh before but I like this place much better. The only thing that could be changed is the parking but it was solved rather easily because all the local cars park on the street so we just did like them =))) ####[['The hotel was really cozy yet spacious for a family', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The location was very convenient', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hotel was near Hon Gai and Bai Chay beach, Sunworld Park and Quang Ninh museum and so many tourist attractions', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' It took me only 10-30 minutes to get to any famous places that I wanted', 'Amenity', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The room has 2 bedrooms and it looks just like new and of course, very clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hosts are nice too, he seems to take care of his property very well', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['With that level of price, this is such an optimal choice', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The only thing that could be changed is the parking but it was solved rather easily because all the local cars park on the street so we just did like them ', 'Amenity', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ["I've stayed in Muong Thanh before but I like this place much better", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

1294,We stayed at Golden Holiday for a few days, in a total of 3 rooms. I'm going to give you lots of details about our stay, so you can see if it is right for you. Short story - we really enjoyed it!First the rooms - rooms are quite large, with very nice sheets, towels, pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers. We're not talking super high-end, but for the price the rooms are great. Some rooms have a small sofa - ask if your room has one, or request one. Wi-fi worked great> Toilets worked well, with nice bidets attached. If you want a large, comfortable room - I don't think you can go wrong here. Staff - staff are great. This place is well staffed, there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk, always willing to go out of their way for you. Especially Thuy and Ms. Kim - they are fantastic and will help make your stay very enjoyable. They often called "electric shuttles" for us, which worked well for transporting 5 people from 1 - 3km away. Breakfast - there is a large breakfast buffet available every day from 7 to 10AM. Ours was included in the room rates. There was great coffee, also fruits, salads, asian, and some western items. Some days there were bacon and chocolate crossaints. You could always get eggs cooked anyway you liked. No pancakes or waffles, but I don't think these are very common in Vietnam. It was easy to grab some pastries to go from the breakfast buffet so you had some snacks for later on. Pool - there was a medium sized pool outside. It was nice, clean - not super huge but large enough to do laps in it. Location - it is located right on a semi-busy street, but we never heard noise from our rooms, as it is set back a bit from the road. There are plenty of spas and restaurants in the area - but you are outside of the super busy, noisy "old town" tourist area. It is a quick 5 min electric shuttle ride ($2 usd) or a 22 minute walk to the main "old town" walking areas. ####[['we really enjoyed it', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' rooms are quite large, with very nice sheets, towels, pillows - and a large bathroom with good showers', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["We're not talking super high-end, but for the price the rooms are great", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Some rooms have a small sofa', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Wi-fi worked great', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Toilets worked well, with nice bidets attached', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['staff are great', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['This place is well staffed, there are usually 2 or 3 receptionsts at the front desk, always willing to go out of their way for you.

138475,They were all very nice, and the hotel is really central. We arrived late at night, so we asked for a transfer from the airport. The lady was very nice to us, but we realised that we would pay 400. 000 vd, which is a lot for this transfer from the airport. (If we had gone by taxi, we would pay only around 130. 000 vd...) When we got to the hotel, a really nice man was there to receive us. The small room that we booked had no windows, so we upgraded to the bigger room. The hotel is OK, not fancy (we have to watch out for the cockroachs), but it's really central, and we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night, and also the air-conditioning machine outside (which is normal in Vietnam). When we were leaving, we asked the man if he could please call a taxi, and we expected no more fees from the hotel. Until we realised that the lady came to collect our money, saying that her car would take us to the airport (for 220. 000 vd). Of course, it was not her car, and she paid the taxi and got a fee from our money. We're not sure how much she paid the taxi, but it should be around 120. 000 vd, and the rest of the 100. 000 vd went to her pocket. It wasn't correct of her, and we felt robbed. I'd definitely not recommend this hotel, and if you do stay there, ALWAYS GET A TAXI YOURSELF, or give the extra money to the person that actually drives you.. ####[['They were all very nice', 'Branding', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the hotel is really central', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The lady was very nice to us', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['but we realised that we would pay 400. 000 vd, which is a lot for this transfer from the airport', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['When we got to the hotel, a really nice man was there to receive us', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' The small room that we booked had no windows, so we upgraded to the bigger room', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hotel is OK, not fancy ', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['we can hear the music from the bars nearby during the night, and also the air-conditioning machine outside', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' we realised that the lady came to collect our money, saying that her car would take us to the airport (for 220. 000 vd).

1300,The breakfast served at the pantry on the 5th floor every morning was good because I could have a light breakfast. In particular, the soup of rice noodles is very delicious, so I recommend you to try it. The location of the accommodation is near Miding, but it's a little far away. Please note that it's not a distance that you can't walk at all, but it'll be a burden to walk in the middle of the heat. Fortunately, you can visit various attractions in Hanoi using the grap service. The room condition is very very excellent. A comfortable bed and living room(has a comfortable sofa) are provided, and simple cooking is possible with a simple kitchen. I was able to travel comfortably because they cleaned and managed it every day. Also, there was a washing machine on the balcony, and it was so nice to be able to wash wet clothes with sweat. The product description says that there are four bathrooms in three rooms, but in reality, there are three bathrooms in three rooms. The toilet tissue location is so far away that you have to twist your body into an acrobatic way to touch the tissue. There is no space to put shampoo or soap in the shower booth. There's not enough space to put soap in the sink. In addition, it does not provide soap.

1354,very clean. Staff is very nice and Family dinners were very delicious. An helped us check in really early in the morning and kept checking with us during the whole stay, which was lovely. They dropped me off at the bus station for Mui Ne which was above and beyond. This hostel isn’t the same one that all the reviews rave about because they moved during Covid. Booking’s description says there’s a patio bar and has lots of reviews talk about the roof, and at this location those don’t exist. Also, on booking. com the address is wrong (correct address as of 4/23 is Alley 1/5A, Đường Lê Hồng Phong, Phường 4, Thành phố Đà Lạt, Lâm Đồng, Vietnam) which meant that I showed up to the old hostel address at 4:30 in the morning. Not ideal. We did the classic Mr. Peace tour, which was okay but on the pricier side compared to the rest of vietnam. 35$ for the day, which didn’t include meals, weasel coffee, or gas if you drive yourself. You get to see a lot though which is cool. ####[['very clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Staff is very nice and Family dinners were very delicious', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['An helped us check in really early in the morning and kept checking with us during the whole stay, which was lovely', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They dropped me off at the bus station for Mui Ne which was above and beyond', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We did the classic Mr. Peace tour, which was okay but on the pricier side compared to the rest of vietnam', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['35$ for the day, which didn’t include meals, weasel coffee, or gas if you drive yourself', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], [' You get to see a lot though which is cool', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

139608,The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport. The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance. Owner stays just next door so it’s easy to reach out if you have any issues provided that she’s at home. Room is comfy and clean. Aircon is a little weak but it works. Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair. Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin. Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin. Owner gave the pin to the metal gate via message through Booking. com’s app but just note that the metal gate is right in front of the apartment on the 5th floor, not the big gate on ground floor facing the street. Since the apartment is located on the 2nd street away from the main road, it’s not too noisy at night. The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries. There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe. The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift. Luckily there is a cement strip laid over the staircase which probably is meant for bicycles but it works fine to roll my small suitcase up. You’re also supposed to pay your room fee upon arrival in cash - which the fault is mine since I didn’t read carefully before booking. So be prepared to bring extra cash, or exchange money in the many shops at the night market. ####[['The apartment is strategically located in the old quarter and is close to bus stop that goes to and fro the Noi Bai International airport', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The night market and lake area is also within 15min walking distance', 'Amenity', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Aircon is a little weak but it works', 'Facility', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['Hair dryer is also strong enough for my thick long hair', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Owner also provided a big jug of water prior to your checkin', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Communication is also clear so I can do self checkin', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The fridge in the room is also cold enough to store your groceries', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There is a big supermart located across the street but it mainly sells imported goods from Asia and Europe', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The apartment is located on the 5th floor with no lift', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Room is comfy and clean', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

Phoung and his lovely wife took so well care of me, they treat their guests literally like family. I initially wanted to stay only one night as a stop over coming from Sapa, heading to Hanoi. However I liked it so much instantly, that I decided to stay 2 nights. The freshly cooked breakfast and dinner, eaten together with the family, was the best meals I have had in Vietnam. Phoung brought me on a boat trip on Thac Ba Lake, which was amazing. In the evening he brought me and one other guest from India to play volleyball and dance together with his wife and her friends in the village.

105,My family and I had a very comfortable stay at Hanoi Silk Centre hotel. The location is great. It’s in the centre of the old quarter but it’s peaceful and quiet inside. The hotel is lovely but the staff are what makes it a great place. All the staff are so friendly, especially Ms Karathy and Jay. Ms Karathy booked our transfer from the airport, our trip to Ha Long Bay and was so helpful in making sure everything was sorted before we arrived. Jay made us feel so welcome and went above and beyond to help us out. The day of our check out, the staff kindly allowed us to leave our luggage at the hotel for the entire day until evening, when we picked up our bags to catch our overnight train to Hue. My dad accidentally left his medication in the hotel room and only realised when we got to the train station. We contacted the hotel and Jay assured us that he and the staff would find it, fortunately, they did find the medication and Jay hopped on his scooter to hand deliver the meds to us at the train station. We were so grateful that he went above and beyond and enabled us to enjoy the rest of our holiday.
