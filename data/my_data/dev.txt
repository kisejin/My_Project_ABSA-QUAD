1467,This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach. The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach, but since the beach wasn't very busy, you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across. The resort itself is extensive but it doesn't feel too large; it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends, so these times are busy. The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps. There are plenty of beds around that pool and you can have drinks there. The restaurant is good, so spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option. The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration. On the whole, the design of the place is amazing, with plenty of Koi carp ponds, wooden carving, well-maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms. The staffs were amazing and it's really nice to talk to them (thank you Ann!). What has been the best for us was the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil, a nice pool, the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well (Covid had closed that down). It's worth it staying there for a week or more if you're looking for a relaxing pool/beach holiday, but for food you have to either use their restaurant, or use a few local restaurants nearby - or go into town, of course (which you have to as Hoi An is an amazing, but touristy, town!) It's not so much what we didn't like, but maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well. Also, the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient, but the last one back from town is at 17. 30, so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back, which is a bit of a hassle when it gets busy. ####[['This resort is set a short walking distance to the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the design of the place is amazing, with plenty of Koi carp ponds, wooden carving, well-maintained gardens and charming paths between the rooms', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [" The staffs were amazing and it's really nice to talk to them", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' the pool area reserved for adults - it was tranquil, a nice pool, the gardens overlooked the river and they were busy restoring the restaurant there as well', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [" It's worth it staying there for a week or more if you're looking for a relaxing pool/beach holiday", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['maybe they can serve drinks near the quiet pool area as well', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], [' the shuttle service between the resort and town is very convenient, but the last one back from town is at 17. 30, so if you want to have food in town you need a taxi ride back', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The resort itself is extensive', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The main pool is great for the kids and has a great looking fountain consisting of Koi carps', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['There are plenty of beds around that pool', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The restaurant is good', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['spending a whole day near the pool and having lunch nearby is an option', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' you can have drinks there', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The rooms very comfortable with good beds and we liked the decoration', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The resort has a small private part reserved on that beach', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["the beach wasn't very busy, you can go anywhere and have a good time near the sea with a great view of the islands across", 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' it is used by the Vietnamese as a getaway for the weekends, so these times are busy', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

It has lots of hangers which was very useful for our winter jackets. They also had Netflix on the TV right in front of the bed, which made this place felt more homey. The elevator was small but worked just fine. I've read some reviews that you need to go up through small stairs, but that happened if your property is at 11th floor above. Ours was in 10th so it was fine. The host was very communicative and supportive during our stay. p. s. They also had motorbike rent, but manual only. The bed was a bit thinner that usual bed, so it was not as comfy as your common hotel bed, but we slept just fine. The blanket was very comfortable though so it helped. The ceiling was a bit low and the room was a bit older than the photos, but it was fine. There's no good food around the place and it was about 10 mins by motorbike from Old Quarter. So, you have to rent motorbike if you wanna go to the nearest popular spots.

The house in itself is super convenient and if you go to the first floor you can have a wonderful view. There are many comfortable sits that allow you to take a nap while watching those famous rice fields. 2/ The owner, Emma, who can speak English, has been absolutely lovely with me ! She helped me in so many ways and made me feel at home which is a wonderful feeling when you are far away from your country. You can ask her to help you to plan your future destination (call a taxi, car etc….) which is super useful especially in Vietnam. 3/ Everything is super clean : the bathrooms, toilets, kitchen, rooms, beds etc so it feels like you are in a really nice hotel. 4/ The food was delicious so I recommend you to eat there from time to time (the breakfast (I have chosen pancakes) was really good and the cooker prepared the best tomato tofu of my life. ####[[' This place looks like paradise on earth', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Moc Home is A Big house, with a pool, and a garden in the most beautiful mountains of Vietnam ', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' I was shocked about how beautiful the place was', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The owner, Emma, who can speak English, has been absolutely lovely with me !

Mrs Phuong woke up to let us in when we arrived at 1am and gave us a lovely room. They had an elevator as well which was heaven for us after being up 5 flights of stairs in Hanoi! The room was clean, spacious and had a balcony, TV and refrigerator. The hotel is right opposite the train station so easy to get to. We rented bikes from them for only 100K a day, Mrs Phuong gave me a quick lesson as I hadn’t rode for years. Overall a lovely stay and would recommend to anyone.

The highlight of my stay was Ms Vy, she is an excellent host! Ms Vy accompanied me to the local banh mi festival that was happening during my stay. She was great, explaining the local dishes and helping me order food. With her I got to try many delicious Vietnamese food. After that we went on a walk and did a little bit of sightseeing. She also gave a little map with everything explained, including some words in Vietnamese in case you need to ask directions to locals!

975,The bed was solid and comfortable. Rubber flip flop and hairdryer provided. Great location 1min from the beach, 1min from a great variety of restaurants and shops, 20min walking to city centre. The tiled floor in the room looked spotless but under the bed there was all sort of rubbish (incl. a dead cockroach) that would fly around when the window was open. There is just one socket just on one side of the bed. The a/c pointed right at the bed head making very uncomfortable to sleep. The balcony was just 300mm deep, not made to sit outside nor hang your towel after being at the beach. The handrail was totally rusty. The view from every window of the building opens on the rubbish thrown in the perimeter land. The toliet sit is 5fingers smaller than the toilet itself. Shower water runs weak but it works incl. hot water. Very poor breakfast incl. coffee, tea, bread, ham and some fruit. Some staff members din't speak english and they din't make any effort to understand me.

They advertise 24 hour reception so I thought nothing of checking out early in the morning to catch my 6 AM bus to the airport. There was nobody in reception except a security guard who, upon my spouse and I loading our bags onto the bus, proceeded to make a scene (yelling at myself and the driver) that I had yet to pay. I went inside to pay and found out he (security guard) could not administer payment. He had trouble getting ahold of the man in charge of reception. Meanwhile my bus driver was beginning to unload our things and was attempting to kick us off the bus as we were now behind schedule. I pleaded to him, explaining that the hotel had my credit info and I could be billed, and made the same plea to the security guard. To no avail. I was now refusing to get off the bus because I had a flight to catch, and caught between two men screaming at eachother and at me. I'm not sure I've faced that level of anxiety before in my life. All due to a false promise of 24 hour reception. Anyway, don't rely on the 24 hour reception, and don't expect to be treated with common decency by the staff (this doesn't apply to the guy working reception, he was actually kind and respectful). ####[['Comfortable bed.

1783,I had an absolutely wonderful stay at this apartment. The location was amazing, with a plethora of authentic local food options just a 5-minute walk away. However, the highlight for me was the stunning pool, where I spent many relaxing moments and admired the beautiful surroundings. Additionally, sitting on the balcony and enjoying a drink was a delightful experience. Hannah, the host, was simply fantastic. She was incredibly kind and helpful throughout my stay, providing valuable suggestions on local attractions and activities. Thanks to Hannah's support, I had an incredible travel experience without any issues. I am genuinely satisfied with my stay and cannot wait to return. I highly recommend this apartment to anyone seeking a memorable vacation. Not only does it boast an excellent location, but it is also comfortable and well-equipped. I had plenty of space to relax and make the most of my holiday. The balcony offered a lovely spot to take in the scenery and enjoy breakfast or an evening beverage.

138323,absolutely gorgeous, even better in real life - felt like a boutique-y four seasons. the bar on the top floor was beautiful and all of the food at the restaurant fantastic. whoever designed or built the hotel is clearly a world traveler with impeccable taste. gym was really nice too (did not take advantage of the spa) service was great except at the pool - constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the (quite large) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don’t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down. It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting, you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes. Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment, you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot (or didn’t understand because of language barrier?). Then by then the food is cold. Frequently saw 2-3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention. Also, the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours (this was a Monday afternoon) stirring up lots of insects. Why isn’t this done early morning or evening when there are less people trying to enjoy the pool? If it weren’t for the pool experience being unpleasant, I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation. Because of this, I don’t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn’t enjoyable to sit by the pool. But we still would come back for the rooms, gym and food. ####[['absolutely gorgeous, even better in real life', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' all of the food at the restaurant fantastic', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the bar on the top floor was beautiful', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['felt like a boutique-y four seasons', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['gym was really nice too', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['service was great except at the pool', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['constantly had to walk all the way to the restaurant or around the (quite large) pool to get attention of servers who would walk around collecting glasses or refilling the water etc but don’t actually pay attention to clients trying to wave them down', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['It was disappointing that at a place like this after you walk to the restaurant from the other side of the pool to ask for a menu and show the server where you are sitting, you have to walk back again because no one actually comes by to take your order after 15 minutes', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Then when food is served and you ask for a condiment, you have to walk back to the restaurant another 15 minutes later to remind them because they forgot', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Then by then the food is cold', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Frequently saw 2-3 servers standing around the restaurant entrance chatting with each other and not looking around while people at the pool were trying to get their attention', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['the grass cutting by the pool was super loud and lasted for hours', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['stirring up lots of insects', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['I don’t think we would come back again for more than one night because it isn’t enjoyable to sit by the pool', 'Loyalty', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['But we still would come back for the rooms, gym and food', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['If it weren’t for the pool experience being unpleasant, I would say this is the perfect place for a staycation', 'Branding', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

The taxi system between Sapa and the hotel was a bit time-consuming and expensive (200k VND each way), the driver is sometimes busy with other passengers, so it can take 20+ minutes until you're picked up.

Apart from the additional fee, entrance requires a resident's approval which was quite a hassle, we had to contact Merry House's staff and waited outside the pool for 15 minutes until they got someone to let us in.

1498,The hostel's staff is one of the nicest and kindest I've met during my travesl. They always take interest in you and are very patient and helpful, and give the hostel a homey feeling. The rooms are spacious, nice and cosy, good smell, and the beds are super comfortable. I really liked the storage arrangment. I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that! The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom. First, it was located on the bottom floor seperated from all the rooms in the hostel. The way there is exposed with no ceiling. On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom. I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way. The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well. As it is raining quite often in Sapa I think that's a problem... also there's only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel. Another thing to mind is the location - it's about 10-15 min. climb up the hill from town. It's not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather. ####[["The hostel's staff is one of the nicest and kindest I've met during my travesl", 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['They always take interest in you and are very patient and helpful, and give the hostel a homey feeling', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' The rooms are spacious, nice and cosy, good smell, and the beds are super comfortable', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['I really liked the storage arrangment', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' I decided to extend my stay thanks to all of that', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The main thing that bothered me during my stay was the bathroom', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The way there is exposed with no ceiling', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['On my last night there it was cold and raining for hours and I had to go to the bathroom', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' I had no choice but to get completely wet on my way', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The path there was flooded so my feet got all wet as well', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [" there's only 2 toilets and 3 showers for the entire hostel", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["Another thing to mind is the location - it's about 10-15 min", 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['climb up the hill from town', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [" It's not that bad but can be difficult with luggage or in bad weather", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

Easy connectivity to main roads, the Hoi An Old village area and all other attractions are just a 15 min. Don't want to walk the villa will provide cycles free of cost. They can also arrange scooters for you to roam around the Hoi An. Will definitely recommend! ####[['The villa is beautifully located surrounded by River on one side and open views', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Easy connectivity to main roads, the Hoi An Old village area and all other attractions are just a 15 min', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Will definitely recommend', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL']]

There are flowers and plants everywhere which just add an extra layer to the place. The staff were also very helpful in arranging taxis into Sapa and Cat Cat Village. Since the bungalows are quite close together, there were a few guests who were incredibly loud which disturbed our sleep.

524,We ended up staying at the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, so I can only comment on that. Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom. We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool. Breakfast was very good and a sensible price. if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel. Very handy little shop called Moon Milk on the street corner. A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage. The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing. We landed on a (relatively) cold and rainy evening and took the long taxi ride from Da Nang airport. The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance. We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that. There was a notice on the door saying to go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel instead, giving the address. A sketch map would have been useful! It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel. The gentleman on reception took us up to a room, leading in and coming back out very rapidly. Obviously there was some kind of problem, and he wished to be professional about it. He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card. We were ushered to another room, which was clearly an upgrade. Whilst it lacked a couple of things (such as a toilet roll, which appeared the next day), it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom. To the credit of the manager, he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances. ####[['Very nice room with huge bed and an impressively sized bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['We had a balcony overlooking the swimming pool', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Breakfast was very good and a sensible price', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['if we were going back to Hoi An we would go to the Thanh Binh Central Hotel', 'Loyalty', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['A short walk to the pretty part of town and the river frontage', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The mural of the Japanese covered bridge at the end of the pool is was actually nicer than the real thing', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The driver had a bit of difficulty locating the hotel as it was in darkness and closed for maintenance', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We had received a message saying that they would sort out suitable accommodation on arrival but had not really known what was meant by that', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['A sketch map would have been useful', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' It turned out to be literally around the corner and a very nice hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The gentleman on reception took us up to a room, leading in and coming back out very rapidly', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' He rushed off and quickly came back with another key card', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Obviously there was some kind of problem, and he wished to be professional about it', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['We were ushered to another room, which was clearly an upgrade', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Whilst it lacked a couple of thing', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['it had features such as a private balcony and a massive bathroom', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['To the credit of the manager, he took an inauspicious start and left us feeling that we had done well in the circumstances', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

The room I stayed in had no window, so it was quite stuffy, but that was expected for the price. I peeped into a renovated higher end room on that floor (the door was open because of the construction), and it looked pretty good.

1309,Perfect location. Friendliest staff, extremely helpful in guiding you and never felt like they are only after money. Free bicycle. Infact, their transport from hotel to airport was cheaper than GRAB taxi which I liked. Really comfortable and peaceful place 2 km away from the old town. Highly rated restaurants just across the street from the hotel 100m walk. Staff members Ms. My and Ms. Lee were especially awesome in the arrangements and warm nature. 10/10 I recommend this place.

544,Nice looking room, spacious with a bath. Our mistake not to check but about 1. 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started. This is a really noisy place, the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning (5. 30am) people using power tools. There are rodents in the roof. The bathroom looks great but the water doesn't flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over. The bath is really nice, but the hot water only fills about 1/5 of it at a time. Not that we would have used it, as it was too cold, but the pool was empty. Staff at reception were unwelcoming, didn't provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don't speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also, so made it hard to communicate at all. An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren't asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine, but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc. let alone wanted something else. We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves. When we realised this wasn't going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out. We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left. No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty because the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were 'unlaunderable' and had to pay 180,000 dong to replace them! So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins. So, this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam and don't recommend it at all. If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access. ####[['Nice looking room, spacious with a bath', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Our mistake not to check but about 1. 5km from tourist area so have to walk everywhere just to get started', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['This is a really noisy place, the venue next door has loud music at night and early in the morning', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['people using power tools', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['There are rodents in the roof', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The bathroom looks grea', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ["the water doesn't flow to the drain properly and so the gloss tiles remain wet and slippery and we both nearly fell over", 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The bath is really nice', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the hot water only fills about 1/5 of it at a time', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Not that we would have used it, as it was too cold, but the pool was empty', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["Staff at reception were unwelcoming, didn't provide any orientation or offer any tourism advice and don't speak English and seemed to struggle with Google translate also, so made it hard to communicate at all", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["An example of this was for breakfast we sat down and weren't asked what we wanted and were provided with a pho which was fine, but we could have had allergies or been vegetarian etc. let alone wanted something else", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We had to take out the rubbish from our room ourselves', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["When we realised this wasn't going to be the place for us we offered to pay for the night stayed and asked to check out", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We were refused by the owner over the phone and said we would have to pay the full 3 night fee even if we left', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['No bath mats provided and so we used face washers on the floor which got dirty', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [" the floor was dirty and on check out were told they were 'unlaunderable' and had to pay 180,000 dong to replace them", 'Branding', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' So we went and washed them in the sink ourselves and not surprisingly they came clean in 2 mins', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' this was the most disappointing stay of our entire time in Vietnam', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["don't recommend it at all", 'Loyalty', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' If you have mobility issues you would also struggle to get up the steep steps in the property and there is no vehicle access', 'Amenity', 'Negative', 'NULL']]

139603,Location: 300-800m near buses, Co-Op mart, and 10-15 min walk to the main beaches. Personnel: the owner/receptionist is particularly annoying. 1. there is no price list. So she could charge anything, disregarding the Booking's price. if you don't agree she would put you in a small stuffy smoking-smelling room, not as in the picture advertised. You are not allowed to remove the tray. 2. there is no cup/glass, or kettle available to discourage eating or drinking in the room. She had a set mind and tried to rule you as much as possible such as locking away all remote controls in the draw, and telling me that" no need to touch /change them". 3. When I complained about the TV not working and the water from the basin leaking on the bathroom floor, she was very argumentative, trying to put the blame on me. Instead of examining the problems or being willing to fix the issues. She was loud and aggressive and disregarded anything I said or requested persistently. She would never stop talking, once she was in my room. 4. The first day when I arrived I gave her my ID, she did not have any question. After she got to know me in he afternoon, she asked me if I have money to lend her, I laughed and left. When I got back that night I told her that I was very sick. She did not care but kept dragging on questioning my ID , trying to cause me trouble. I was very tired and sick and she would not leave me alone. When I told her that I was willing to pack my bag and leave immediately (eventhough it was almost midnight). She then shut up, and let me go to rest. The next day, the Bell boy asked me nicely if I would stay another day as booked, and tried fixing the leaking basin. So I stayed and She left me alone since. 5. Everyday, room was not cleaned nor rubbished being collected so brought them down to reception bin, she made me to throw them outside the building site. Lastly, I forgot to collect my ID after settling the account. upon realising, I called and asked her nicely to send it to my address in Saigon. ####[['300-800m near buses, Co-Op mart, and 10-15 min walk to the main beaches', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['he owner/receptionist is particularly annoying', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["there is no price list.

The receptionist gave us many suggestions for good local restaurants. She is kind and patient. The place itself looks new and well-kept.

I hope the property could improve bathroom cleanliness as it could be better in the future. The receptionist area and the breakfast could be quite hot sometimes without AC turning on.

1010,I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential. With its prime location opposite the beach, attentive staff, and impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products, my overall experience was positive. While the hotel showed promise in many aspects, the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay. I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel's recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time. It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences. However, considering the hotel had only been operational for two weeks, this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy. ####[['I recently had the opportunity to stay at a newly built hotel that showcased great potential', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' its prime location opposite the beach', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' attentive staff', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['impressive use of Crabtree & Evelyn products, my overall experience was positive', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['the breakfast options were somewhat lacking during my stay', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [" I suspect that the limited choices were due to the hotel's recent opening and perhaps a low guest count at the time", 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' It would have been ideal to see a wider variety of dishes to cater to different preferences', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], [' this shortcoming could potentially be addressed as the establishment gains more experience and regular occupancy', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

1516,This is a cozy family home that has everything you need. Don't expect anything too fancy though. As a solo travel who usually stays at hostels, it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel. The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening. The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I've stayed at. Bathroom was shared but was always empty. The private room also locks. Everything I could ask for! Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market. The stairs inside the home are a little challenging. The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small (I had to navigate them going down with my feet sideways). Fortunately, my room was on the first level above ground, but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you. Also, finding the apartment was a little tricky. Finding the address of the building was fine. Take the concrete stairs up a flight and go down the first hall to your right. There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it's easy to miss. I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end, but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn't confirm if I was at the right place. I left but ended up being redirected back to the apartment. The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English. The whole family is lovely, but it can be hard to find the apartment. ####[['This is a cozy family home that has everything you need', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' it was nice to have a private room and not have to shell out for a hotel', 'Experience', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The hosts are so friendly and offer free dinner every evening', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [" The Wi Fi here was better than at most hotels I've stayed at", 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Bathroom was shared but was always empty', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['The private room also locks', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Everything I could ask for', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Location was phenomenal beside the walking street and Ben Thanh market', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' The stairs inside the home are a little challenging', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The slope is steep and the steps themselves are small', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [' finding the apartment was a little tricky', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['my room was on the first level above ground, but I believe there are multiple levels so keep this in mind if this would be difficult for you', 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The main host is a woman who speaks a bit more English', 'Service', 'Neutral', 'NULL'], ['The whole family is lovely', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' it can be hard to find the apartment', 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], [" I followed the sign and the apartment is at the very end, but I was confused because an elderly woman greeted me and I couldn't confirm if I was at the right place", 'Experience', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ["There is a sign that directs you to the homestay but it's easy to miss", 'Experience', 'Neutral', 'NULL']]

421,Incredibly comfortable bed. Great location. Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements. Preface: Their claim is "Beyond Perfection" and it is marketed as a "Luxury Boutique" 5 star hotel. While beautifully designed, many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience (function of light switches, relative position of shower and towel for maximum water coverage of said towels, maintenance work during check-out hours) and some elements already are showing wear and tear. For a 5 star hotel, the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training, with very odd formalities that were unnecessary, poorly executed, or just awkward. We also received a phone call to our room at 4:48am, which was a mistake by reception. When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves. (The manager did reimbursed us for transport when it was brought to her attention) The cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed. Known classics were watered down and almost unrecognisable in their taste. ####[['Incredibly comfortable bed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['Great location', 'Amenity', 'Positive', 'NULL'], [' Breakfast was really good and catered for many tastes and requirements', 'Service', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['beautifully designed', 'Facility', 'Positive', 'NULL'], ['many details and materials used were not thought through for actual convenience', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['some elements already are showing wear and tear', 'Facility', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['For a 5 star hotel, the staff seemed to still be inexperienced or still in training, with very odd formalities that were unnecessary, poorly executed, or just awkward', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['We also received a phone call to our room at 4:48am, which was a mistake by reception', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['When we checked out the staff were not aware of it and we had to tell them what happened ourselves', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['Known classics were watered down and almost unrecognisable in their taste', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL'], ['The cocktails in the bar very extortionately priced yet very poorly executed', 'Service', 'Negative', 'NULL']]
